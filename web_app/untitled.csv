#**.gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format submissions only, please!**

#**Submissions cannot contain sound**

**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem if it requires more detail.**

------------------

1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post gifs that have already appeared on /r/gifs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past, but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

  **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

  Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.
   
 *This rule is meant to keep things fresh. Reposts will be removed, however a good gif that did very badly the first time around may be given a second chance. We also don't wish to discourage cross-posting in general (it's even encouraged by reddiquette), but if something was recently popular elsewhere, we want to let the original post stand on its own for a while before it comes to /r/gifs.*

 *Please note that the cross-post rule applies* ***at the time of posting***. *We don't want to punish users who were within the rules when they made their post. For example, if a post has 1000 points elsewhere, and someone cross-posts it here, but a few hours later the original post has gone past 1500 points, that's fine.*

2. **No Reaction, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)  
   
 *The [/r/reactiongifs wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_reaction_gif.3F) explains this well. Just because a gif has a reaction in it doesn't make it a reaction gif.*

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs *or content much better suited to video formats* will be removed.  **20 seconds maximum duration.** (This rule does not apply to comments)  
   
 *Gifs are a short-form format, so if a gif doesn't provide any benefit, or a video format is preferable, it isn't allowed. For example, these may be removed...*
 * *Gifs that require audio to be properly appreciated.*
 * *Gifs with many cuts to different scenes.*
 * *Gifs with a file size over 15mb.*

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!  
  
 *Image/gallery pages are prone to malicious ads or editing in spam in the text areas, so we require direct linking to prevent this. URL shorteners are on reddit's site-wide spam filter, because you can hide anything in a URL shortener and people have no idea what their browser will open.*

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault in posts or comments.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.  

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading in posts or comments.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments.  
  
 *This includes trying to rile people up over another reddit user's activities. There are always many sides to everything, and we've seen reddit go after the wrong person many times.*

7. ***Nudity, porn, gore, and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.*** Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Please mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.**  
  
 *Risqué posts (girls in bikinis, for instance) are fine as long as it's tagged as NSFW and isn't overtly sexual. Porn, gore, nudity, and sex acts are bannable offenses in posts or comments. Anything causing grievous bodily harm or death is considered gore, even if there's no gore shown.*

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** Do not make submissions with the title ""This"", ""This is my favorite gif"", etc.

9. **No hate speech of any kind in posts or comments.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  
  
 *Making fun of or belittling any person or people based on race, sex, gender, sexual preference, disability, or other characteristics is likely to get you banned. Language that goes past the standard ""internet tough guy"" banter may result in a removal or ban, depending on the severity.*

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts or comments violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

AMA!,,"Hi everyone! I am Aaron Labbé, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of [LUCID](https://www.thelucidproject.ca) \- a startup innovating mental health through music. Nine years ago I was diagnosed with Bi-polar 1 Disorder, after over a year of un-diagnosed mania and psychosis that caused a number of lasting scars in my life.

In February 2012, I was forcibly hospitalized for the first time and kicked out of the music conservatory I was studying at. My life has never been the same since. That hospital experience itself was traumatizing. I had a doctor tell me to cope with the fact that I couldn't finish school, wouldn't be able to keep a professional job, and should ultimately settle into a more passive lifestyle.

Before this experience, my dream was to be a professional musician - but at that point I decided to dedicate my life to creating a more empathetic mental health system. In the last years of my 2nd round of university, I came up with a really big idea. That idea has grown into a company of ten artists, musicians and engineers. We have spent the last 2 years working tirelessly to turn music into a validated medicine for mental health.

If you also struggle with anxiety, stress, or any other mental health challenges - know that you’re not alone, and there’s help out here! We recently started [a program](http://www.thelucidproject.ca/mental-health-support-covid) to offer our music for mental health app (all premium features unlocked) for free to anyone who’s struggling and can’t afford the subscription. Additionally, all healthcare and essential workers can receive [free subscriptions](http://www.thelucidproject.ca/frontline), to support them in the tireless mental battle against COVID-19.

Hi everyone!

I began my career as a high school teacher in Louisiana, where I witness the school-to-prison pipeline in person everyday. My experience drove me to study law in Portland, Oregon and land my first job out of Lewis & Clark Law School at the Multnomah District Attorney office as a Deputy DA. In 2015, I left that office (I was appointed by the governor) to run a justice reinvestment and research state agency called the Criminal Justice Commission. As director, I led projects and fought for legislation that decreases racial disparities and for treating addiction like a health issue, not a criminal justice issue. **You can read more about my background** [**here**](https://www.mikeschmidtforda.com/about/)**.**

AMA!,,"**My short bio:** I have worked at sea for a few years now, and was unlucky enough to be at sea when all of the 'rona started. I have not set foot on land since March 14th. 

I worked for the cruise company Holland America Line as part of the entertainment team. My ship has been fighting for weeks with the CDC and the US government to let me back into the country, even though I am a US citizen. I'm happy to answer any questions here about what it's like to be at sea for extended periods of time, or what it's like to work at sea in general.

[An article about me](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/04/28/coronavirus-holland-america-oosterdam-cruise-ship-stranded-at-sea/)

EDIT: ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

* Am I being paid? No.

* Have you filed for unemployment? My internet is not strong enough yet. I'm going to try as soon as I get back on land.

* Is anyone onboard sick? No. Or at least, they have not made any announcements about that. Everyone is getting fever tested twice a day.

* How's the food? A bit lower than guest quality, but generally good. [Here's a picture of dinner!](https://imgur.com/a/nFjZoOm) 

* How do you get food? They deliver it to me three meals a day.

* How's the room? It is a 200sq ft cabin to myself. I spend around 20+ hours a day in here alone. I have a balcony and a double bed. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/a/hjwOymp)

* How much is the internet? it's $10 per gigabyte, and the connection is extremely spotty. It drops out usually every 20 and 30 minutes for me, and takes a few minutes to pick back up again. Even phone calls over WhatsApp are hard to make.

* Why don't you jump? It is incredibly dangerous to jump overboard a moving ship. If you jump over the side, there is a good chance that the current drags you underneath the ship and into the propellers. If you jump over the back, the water is heavily aerated and you will get sucked under again. If you manage to swim to the top / hold your breath long enough, you will die of dehydration and exposure if you don't make it to land.

* What happened when you tried to leave the ship? [longer comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gfc3p7/i_am_a_cruise_ship_worker_currently_trapped_at/fpt5vfl)

While ""anosmia"" or ""hyposmia"" (reduced ability to smell) can be treated in some cases, mine will never be and is caused by underdeveloped olfactory nodes.

Feel free to AMA about anosmia or KS, or tell me something weird about smell that I may have never realised.

About the play: HATE MAIL was written about 20 years ago, starting as a sort of parody of the popular theater piece LOVE LETTERS.  It was meant to be performed likewise, just two actors with a simple set reading correspondence. The play has had a really nice life in theaters for the past two decades and it just seemed like a natural fit for these days of pandemic-y online performances.

ALL proceeds from the play will go to **PARTNERS IN HEALTH**, a great non-profit organization dedicated to getting medical health and supplies to those who need it most.  And their specific focus on the Coronavirus pandemic has been excellent:

**\[ADDED SEVERAL HOURS LATER:**  Thank you all!  I got to as many questions as I could and I'll stop by for a bit in a few hours, to see if I can or should answer a few more.  FWIW I tended to skip past questions where I'd already answered something very similar and / or where multiple-part questions made it tough to handle right now.

I'm a 15 year old game developer from Sweden, currently finishing up my game Escape from Life Inc, after working on it after school & weekends for 1.5 years.

I've been into making games since I was about 8, where I got a copy of Clickteam Fusion for christmas. For a couple of years, I never had anything to show for it. I mostly made small prototype games, or when I tried to make something bigger, I just lost interest. My game making journey didn't start properly until I found unity. It was super frustrating at first, but the idea of being able to make 3D games kept me going. I quickly found that 2D games were my passion (The only 3D game I actually ended up making was a walking simulator set in my school...). After making a sequel to one of my clickteam games, I decided I was ready for my first big/commercial project. I played a ton of indie games myself and I wanted to create something similar to those (Think Undertale, Owlboy etc.). After over a year of spending pretty much all my free time on this project, it's nearly done!

Anyway, the game! It's a quirky story-driven puzzle platformer, where you switch between three animals: a walking fish, an arrogant eagle and a stuttering  reindeer! It's full of wacky characters and off-the-wall humor. There's plenty of puzzles, platforming, exploration, adventure game mechanics and a bunch of other stuff! To get a feel for it, check out the trailer or the demo! (both are linked below)

Go ahead and ask me anything: About the game, how I made it, how I get motivation, and how I balance game-making with schoolwork (Spoiler alert: I do it poorly). I'll answer as much as I can :D

AMA about how colleges are handling the pandemic!,,"[Proof](https://www.facebook.com/makeschool/posts/1673959346078508). TL;DR I dropped out of MIT and started a college called [Make School](http://www.makeschool.com). It's the college I wished existed - we offer an accredited, project-based bachelors in applied computer science where you don't have to pay if you're unemployed after graduating. Ordinarily we operate out of a campus in downtown San Francisco but have been operating online since early March. 



I did [an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d9c1mg/i_dropped_out_of_mit_and_started_a_new_college_in/) last fall and most of the questions focused on our no job = no pay model, how legit we actually are, and why a student would ever consider coming to Make School instead of a traditional college.

Since then, the entire calculus behind college choice has changed as colleges have moved online and vary in how prepared they are for the fall. To put it mildly, a lot of students are having sub-par experiences and a lot of colleges may close or significantly cut their offerings over the next few months. It isn't pretty. 

I've had a front-row seat into how colleges are handling the shift online. I'm hearing a lot of students wondering whether they should even go to college this fall, how much is reasonable to go into debt if they do, and how even to go about making those decisions when the future is uncertain.

Whether you've got questions about what it was like starting a college as a college dropout, how colleges are shifting online, or you want advice on your personal situation - AMA!

It's been widely covered by the press over the last couple of weeks and we've been getting tons of questions about it, so thought Reddit would be a great place to answer them. I'm relatively new to Reddit and excited to be here to share/discuss the future of travel post COVID-19 with everyone.

Dollar Flight Club has been around for more than 3 years and here's some proof that a few people find what we do and say useful :) Recent Media: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/future-travel-bookings-pandemic/index.html), [Conde Nast Traveler](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/what-to-consider-before-you-cancel-your-flight), [AFAR Magazine](https://www.afar.com/magazine/top-trending-destinations-with-the-best-airfares-deals-in-2020) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jqlouise/2019/11/01/dollar-flight-club-launches-business-and-first-class-deals/#34633aa363c2), [Fodors](https://www.fodors.com/news/photos/whats-flying-going-to-be-like-post-pandemic), and [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/news/dollar-flight-club-premium-plus/) to name a few.

**Industry Report:**

Late last month, we put together detailed studies on the [COVID-19 impact on the airline industry and airfare prices](https://dollarflightclub.com/industry_reports/covid-19-impact-on-the-airfare-industry-in-2020-and-beyond/) based on data from post 9/11 and the Great Recession as well as the [Impact on Consumer Travel Demand](https://dollarflightclub.com/industry_reports/covid-19-impact-on-travel-demand-in-2020-and-into-the-future) where we surveyed 20,000 of our 1 million members.

Here are some high-level takeaways:

&#x200B;

* Airfare prices will decrease by 35% on average through 2021 and then sharply increase 27% on average (above 2019 levels) through 2025 as demand rebounds.
* Two major US carriers will merge in 2021, further consolidating control of the market.
* Even though facing fewer flight options, travelers will benefit from less flight delays and cancellations.
* Over 40% of travelers will only travel domestically through the end of 2020 due to the outbreak.
* The #1 domestic destination for Christmas/NYE travel is Hawaii.
* The #1 international destination for Christmas/NYE travel is Paris.
* much more...

Before we get started, I want to make it clear that I'm definitely not here to condone travel until it's absolutely safe to do so. Rather, I'm here to discuss the future of travel or anything travel-related you have on your mind.

I can’t wait to answer your questions on the studies and discuss live with the help of my Dollar Flight Club team, starting around 10am PST!

Hey everyone!

My name is Samelys López, and I'm a candidate for New York's 15th Congressional District, which is entirely in the South Bronx. We've been represented by Jose Serrano for 30 years, but he's stepping down.

There are now over 12 people running in the Democratic primary on June 23, including a homophobic Republican who drove Ted Cruz around the Bronx, a City Councilmember who's taken in tens of thousands of dollars from real estate developers, and people who don't even live in the South Bronx.
I am running on a platform to center the needs of the most vulnerable first. We've often been called the poorest congressional district in the country, but we're also the home of salsa, hip hop, and the Young Lords. I'm a part of that rich history of innovation, and taking that to Washington.

While there I will fight for:
* A Homes Guarantee, ensuring that housing is a universal human right for every American
* Medicare for All, so that nobody is denied care or goes bankrupt because of illness
* A Universal Basic Income of at least $2000 a month, so that everyone is able to put food on the table
* Universal childcare, repealing the Hyde Amendment, a $15 minimum wage, a Federal Jobs Guarantee through the Green New Deal, and more

When I was a child, my family experienced homelessness, and I vowed to make sure no other little girl went through what I went through. My policies and campaign style reflect that promise. We're not taking a dime of corporate cash, and the establishment is scared. Our movement has been [endorsed](https://lopezforthepeople.com/endorsements) by New York City DSA, AOC, Tiffany Cabán, Zephyr Teachout, the Working Families Party, Sunrise NYC, and more!

My long-term goal is to help solve the major challenges transitioning to 100% renewable energy. As I sought a career path, it seemed the best position was within the electric utility since 100% renewable energy will require transforming the physical infrastructure and operational power flow of the electric grid.

Design Engineer was my first position in the industry where I was responsible for developing construction packages for new substation equipment. With a recent promotion to Associate Protection Engineer, my new job responsibilities are to calculate relay settings for transmission protection systems. System Protection is considered the most technically challenging and prestigious group within the company. System Protection is an integral part of keeping the complex transmission grid together, and the experience I will gain is absolutely critical to achieving my long-term goal.

So far the response has been great, and I'm here today with my business partner and co-founder Alexander Macdonald to talk about how our new company hopes to change cycling for the better, and will be answering questions about cycling, the competitive racing and the product's at HindSight from 12pm EST.

Our technology is sunglasses with fully integrated rear-view mirrors, allowing cyclists to be significantly more aware of what's happening around them, and therefore able to make smarter decisions, and allowing competitive cyclists to be more tactical in their races.

Everyone who has tried our glasses has changed the way they cycle - they check behind them more, they are proactive on the roads instead of reactive, and each and every one of them has come to us after returning the test model saying they wished they had them for everyday use.

Give our KickStarter video a watch, and please come back with any questions!

If you like our campaign, please share it with your cycling-crazy friends (everybody knows one or two), or support us if you want.

Some of you may know me from around Reddit for my posts about astronomy that start with that catchphrase.

I wanted to celebrate a bit on Reddit because honestly, this community has meant a lot to me over the years- there were some moments in my PhD that were difficult, and I literally found myself thinking ""I *can't* be as bad at astronomy as some people claim if literally thousands of others disagree.""  And honestly, it's just so nice to come here and talk about cool stuff going on in space, and ponder things I wouldn't normally think about thanks to questions from Redditors.  I even put you guys in the acknowledgments for my thesis, so you know I'm serious.

Ask me anything about Mindfulness Meditation for treating anxiety",,"Disclaimer:  This post is for educational and informational purposes only and not a substitute for mental health counseling.”

A lot of my clients come to see me about anxiety and panic attacks and one of the first things I teach them is to use **Mindfulness Meditation** as a daily practice.  Starting at one minute per day (and gradually increasing as it becomes more natural), and maybe using a helpful meditation app like [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/meditation-app), I ask them to focus on their breath.

Here's the important part:  when you notice your mind has wandered, non-judgmentally and with a Kind Inner Voice, return your attention to your breath.  Each time you successfully return your attention to your breath, congratulate yourself.  THIS is the skill you're trying to develop!

So many clients have told me:  ""I can't meditate, it makes me sleepy"" or ""I can't meditate, my mind is too busy with swirling thoughts"" or ""I can't meditate, focusing internally takes me to dark places.""  These are all really good points, and why I encourage people to start at **One Minute per Day**, and to only increase when meditation becomes so comfortable and natural that, at the end of the minute, they find themselves saying ""Wow, that's over already?"".

The purpose of Mindfulness Meditation in counseling (as opposed to other forms and intentions of meditative practices) is **NOT to become calm**!  The purpose is to notice when our minds have wandered off and to be able to return our attention to **the Present Moment**, using our breath as an anchor.  Allowing our minds to wander to our pasts often results in negative thought spirals, leading to Depression.  Allowing our minds to wander to the future often results in anxiety and panic attacks.  Returning our minds to the present moment permits us to have **peace and gratitude**, and to function effectively in our lives.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on Mindfulness Meditation.

Emily from [Froglife](https://www.froglife.org/) (UK reg charity conserving UK native amphibians & reptiles) is doing an AMA on r/gardenwild about UK species, ponds, wildlife gardening, and Froglife. 

# [Click here to join the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/GardenWild/comments/gk8hvv/ama_about_all_things_froglife_ponds_and_the_uks/)",,11,14gkaspk,I am Todd Spoth, commercial & editorial photographer who has worked with NASA astronauts, famous athletes, notorious politicians and your favorite rapper! AMA,,"Hi Reddit!

My name is Todd Spoth and I am a commercial & editorial photographer that has been working full time as a freelance photographer for about 15 years. I am based in Houston, Texas, but my work takes me all over the world. Although I went to college (The University of Houston - Go Coogs!) my degrees were in political science and neuropsychology.

Photography is coincidentally the only class I have ever failed.

I grew up all over the place including spending a couple years in Paris, France during the mid-90’s however most of my youth was spent in Clear Lake City, Texas which is home to NASA’s Johnson Space Center. The Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL - aka the big pool where astronauts train) was right behind our home. My very first job was giving tours to visitors there via Space Center Houston. In recent years, I have had the chance to go back several times to photograph astronauts at the NBL as well as at Johnson Space Center. Back in 2016 I had the pleasure of meeting and photographing an amazing team of newly minted female astronauts training and prepping on campus at JSC. A portrait I made of 4 of them posing on the back of the Mars Exploration Rover was recently published in book called Seeing Science: How Photography Reveals the Universe (Aperture / 2019). They even let me drive it!

For the last 10 years I have been working on an on-going personal project focusing on hip hop artists and culture. I have met and photographed incredible talents from all over the genre including getting a tour into the inner-workings of TV Johnny Dang’s (aka the jeweler to the stars) personal office and showroom to spending a day with Vince Staples running around Austin, TX during SXSW for Billboard. I am known as “Uncle Todd” to more than a few rapper’s children and although I love the live musical experience, I personally am drawn to photographing the moments away from the stage and giving a window into the culture that most don’t normally get to see. I’ve been on the court with Drake, Bun B has been to my house and I’ve been golfing with Scarface.

I have photographed multiple US Presidents, multiple World Series’ and have visited the secretive and private homes of some of the world’s most well-known and controversial figures from Ted Cruz and US Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell (aka the “Lone Survivor”) to more illusive billionaires than I can count on both hands. I have been ‘slimed’ with NBA star Chris Paul for Nickelodeon, and worked with US Olympian Simone Biles on several occasions.

My job is to meet rad people and make them look awesome.

IMO, it's okay for a busy person to hire someone to help with an online class.  But I definitely understand why some people say it's unethical.  

1. **""No, it's not okay to offer academic writing service.""** A large proportion of reddit users are college-educated so they might take offense to the idea of hiring someone to write papers. 
2. **""Yes, it's okay offer academic writing service.""** Reddit users are also shrewd and disillusioned, and they probably know higher education was corrupted already by profiteering, crazy high tuition, and crony-ism, so if you agree with that you might say you do not think it's unethical to hire an academic writer.   

When the school puts classes online, the student is more likely to hire an academic writer. The whole point of putting classes online was for the schools to save money and for corporate america to enable the rat racers to stay productive while they complete degrees.   

People in the fields of nursing or education find themselves working overtime AND they are expected to continue their education.  Same thing with a lot of people who get promoted to a management position and the company sends them to complete their business administration degree - there's not enough time.  

It's \*possible\* to do it without an online class assistant, but not if you want to get enough sleep, be available for family, perform well at work, etc.  

I  feel kind of guilty about how easy things are for me right now as an academic writer. The online class assistant industry is in high  demand.  And now we get more orders than ever because the pandemic caused more classes to be put online. I'm  also fortunate because as a freelance academic writer I can stay in my apartment where it's safe, & I  keep making money.  

AMA!   It's okay if you want to say freelance academic writers are terrible for doing other people's research for them. I used to say the same thing.

My name's Felix. In 2017, I got the opportunity of a lifetime: After searching long and hard for a PhD position that allowed me to write a dissertation on videogames, I not only found an amazing supervisor but also became part of a team that founded a master's programme revolving entirely around the analysis, creation, and technical understanding of the medium in Klagenfurt, Austria.

Ever since then, I have been involved in a large number of videogame-related activities at the university, including the organisation of lesson plans and conferences, the supervision of student projects and indie studio foundations and publications to hosting videogame art exhibitions.

It's been a pretty wild ride that I want to share with you, so ask me anything!

Ask me anything!,,"At the end of 1914 during the First World War it became clear that more hospital beds were urgently needed in England and owners of some country houses volunteered them as convalescent homes. Wrest Park in Bedfordshire was pressed into service as an auxiliary hospital.
 
Wartime hospitals were real social mixing pots. Hospital work threw together people from many different places and vastly different backgrounds, all with a common purpose – caring for the wounded.
 
For the short time they were there, the hospital staff shared the same experiences, the regimented routine and hard graft – but also the lighter moments and camaraderie. It would be an experience that few of them would ever forget.
 
English Heritage is a charity that cares for over 400 historic properties in England. As a Historian I research and help care for lots of these sites, including Wrest Park. Ask me anything!

We're the MIT Technology Review team helping you keep track of them. Ask us anything!",,"Technologists everywhere have been rushing to build apps, services, and systems for contact tracing: identifying and notifying all those who come in contact with a covid-19 carrier. Some are lightweight and temporary, while others are pervasive and invasive: China's system, for example, sucks up data including citizens' identity, location, and even online payment history so that local police can watch for those who break quarantine rules.
 
Opinions differ on whether these apps are just a technocratic daydream or—if done correctly—[a potentially useful supplement](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/28/1000714/five-things-to-make-contact-tracing-work-covid-pandemic-apple-google/) to manual tracing. But the reality is that these services are already rolling out, and many more are likely to come in the next few months.
 
Despite the avalanche of services, however, we know very little about them or how they could affect society. How many people will download and use them, and how widely used do they have to be in order to succeed? What data will they collect, and who is it shared with? How will that information be used in the future? Are there policies in place to prevent abuse?
 
At MIT Technology Review, we started asking these questions and found that there were not always clear answers.
 
So to help monitor this fast-evolving situation, we've gathered the information into a single place for the first time with our [Covid Tracing Tracker](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/)—a database to capture details of every significant automated contact tracing effort around the world.
 
We've been working with a range of experts to understand what we need to look at, pulling sources including government documents, announcements, and media reports, as well as talking directly to those who are making these apps to understand the technologies and policies involved.

Here's the publisher's blurb:
> 
> >When Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in the 1932 election, they represented not only different political parties but vastly different approaches to the question of the day: How could the nation recover from the Great Depression?  
> >  
> >As historian Eric Rauchway shows in Winter War, FDR laid out coherent, far-ranging plans for the New Deal in the months prior to his inauguration. Meanwhile, still-President Hoover, worried about FDR’s abilities and afraid of the president-elect’s policies, became the first comprehensive critic of the New Deal. Thus, even before FDR took office, both the principles of the welfare state, and reaction against it, had already taken form.

AMA!",,"Hello again Reddit! I'm /u/dedalvs, and I've got several things going right now:

* The season premiere of the final season of *The 100* airs tonight on the CW at 8/7C. I created the Trigedasleng language spoken by the Grounders on *The 100*.
* The season finale of the first season of *Motherland: Fort Salem* airs tonight on Freeform at 9/8C. I co-created the Méníshè language spoken by the witches with language creator and linguistics professor Jessie Sams (/u/quothalinguist). The show was just picked up for a second season.
* Jessie and I started a YouTube series called [LangTime Studio](http://langtimestudio.com) in which we create a language live on the stream step-by-step in two hour chunks. The thirteenth episode airs tomorrow at 2 p.m. PDT.

We are POLITICO reporters and an economist – ask us anything about the economy and current federal policy amid Covid-19.",,"The economic impact of the pandemic is staggering. The latest numbers on unemployment claims came out this morning: [2.4 million workers filed for unemployment last week](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/unemployment-claims-numbers-coronavirus-272868), which means 38.6 million Americans – about 23.4% of the workforce – have lost their jobs over the last 9 weeks as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the economy.

(For some context, in normal times, the number of weekly unemployment claims usually hover around a couple hundred thousand.)

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last weekend that [U.S. unemployment could reach a Depression-level 25%](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/17/powell-unemployment-depression-25-percent-264500). Thousands of small businesses are closed and many will remain shut for good after losing all their revenue. The stock market bottomed out in March but has recovered somewhat since then and is now down about 15% from its pre-virus high point.

What officials are trying to do to save the economy:

* Congress has raced to pass multiple rescue bills totalling around $3 trillion in federal support, but they probably still need to send more aid to state and local governments and extend extra jobless benefits.
* The Trump administration is pushing for a swift economic re-opening, but is mostly leaving the official decision-making up to the states.
* The Fed has taken extraordinary measures to rescue the economy – slashing interest rates to zero, rolling out trillions of dollars in lending programs for financial markets and taking the unprecedented step of bailing out state and city governments.

So what does this mean for the future of the U.S. economy? How will we recover and get people back to work while staying safe and healthy? Ask us anything about the current economy amid the Covid-19 crisis and what lawmakers, the Fed, the Trump administration and other groups are trying to do about it.

I was born with about 9 congenital heart defects that made it impossible for my heart to work on its own, so in 1993 at the age of 6 months old, I got my first heart transplant at the Colorado Children's Hospital. Little did the doctors know that that first transplanted heart was defective as well, and eventually failed. When I was about 11 years old, in 2004, I collapsed in the hallways of my elementary school and was rushed to the hospital with heart failure. I got my second heart transplant that year, and it was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. But it saved my life, and I got to go back to school and be a relatively healthy kid until the summer of 2012.

That's when I started getting night sweats, chills, and fever. Being a particularly stubborn person, I ignored the symptoms thinking it was the flu and that it would pass. Finally, when I could barely stand, I went to my family doctor who immediately sent me to the ER. Two weeks later (after being diagnosed with everything from West Nile Virus to Mono), the doctors found a series of tumors on my heart and spine. The tumors were inoperable, so I went through 9 rounds of chemo in the fall of 2012 / spring of 2013. In April of 2013 there was no more tumors to be seen, and I continued my college education that I had started in 2011.

Nowadays, I deal with a lot of the consequences of my transplants and cancer, but the health effects haven't stopped me from pursuing my dream - becoming a licensed counselor so that I can help others through traumatic and life-changing experiences like mine.

Born in San Francisco, California, I moved around with my parents to various states in the South until they settled in Memphis when I was nine. As the oldest child, I watched my parents struggle together to provide the best of what they could give us especially concerning education. I graduated from Bartlett High School in 1996 and received a full scholarship to the University of Tennessee where I received a Bachelor of Science in Communication in 2001.After college, I started my career at FedEx Ground in operations management where I learned the value of process improvement and servant leadership. It was also here that I met my husband, Greg. I was able to leverage my solid foundation of operations and creative problem solving into a career in business consulting and continuous improvement. We moved to Kentucky 10 years ago during the recession, and I fell in love with the state and its people.

Growing up, I was always politically aware with a uniquely inclusive perspective.  I am the child of an immigrant and veteran who as a child was thrust into the Civil Rights Movement.  I grew up with stories of activism as a family history. I grew up believing that our best leaders worked hard and respectfully to represent all of their constituents, not just the ones that voted for them nor for special interests.  I want to carry on this legacy in Congress fighting for everyday working Americans.

I’ve followed the actions and words of the current Representative of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. The words and actions of Thomas Massie are why I decided to run.  I’ve staked my professional career on building consensus in hard business environments. I’ve fought hard to earn a seat at many leadership tables by not going with the status quo.  I did this through the kind of relationship building and servant leadership that we deserve to have in the House of Representatives.  I could continue to be voter with a limited voice but you should know I’m not that kind of person,  I am the kind of fighter that has to stand up when I see something wrong. And right now, we need a fighter for all Kentuckians, not just the 1%. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us in ways we never thought possible. I have been a vocal advocate for the stimulus packages to give more direct payments to Americans, provide rent subsidies, and to stop funneling cash to wall street. This crisis has shown us we need elected officials who will stand up for everyday Americans. Stimulus packages should be bailing out the kitchen table, not the boardrooms.

One of the most important things we must change is making sure healthcare coverage is NOT tied to employment. I believe in the creation of a public option to help make healthcare affordable. The existence of healthcare advocates and rising prescription drug costs within our system demonstrates how much our sick loved ones are exploited by the current system. Kentuckians deserve more from their government. It’s time for our representation to work to meet our needs and protect us from the burgeoning threat of medical bankruptcy.

This Pandemic has created unprecedented levels of unemployment. I believe we should take a lesson from FDR’s public works projects. We can empower Americans with good jobs at a wage that can support families. We can invest in our infrastructure and allow America to be the world leader in climate-friendly 21st century infrastructure. We can no longer ignore the economic, and tragic human toll that climate change is taking on our communities and our world. The United States has always led the world through innovation, it is time for us to do so again. Along with renewable energy projects, we have to update our infrastructure to give broadband access to under served communities. We must also ensure that clean water access is available to every household.

Education is the foundation and lifeblood of our democracy and is required to sustain our republic. I believe in a fully funded public education system where our educators are treated and respected like the highly skilled professionals that they are. I believe in an education system that works to create equity in our society to combat the stereotypes and discrimination of the past. A public education system should provide the same quality education to all students, and not just those in affluent areas. Our children are our future, and our representation in Congress should work to always give them the best opportunities possible. With the Pandemic, I must ask, whose children did we leave behind? With at home learning suddenly being required, how do children without broadband access learn? Kentucky’s average connection speed is lower than what is required to sustain video conferencing. This is why I am focused on broadband being included in any infrastructure bills.

I’ve been a Marine, a farmer, a public school teacher, a college professor, a county government official, and spent five years as a reporter and then editor of a local newspaper.

As a Marine Corps officer, I led marines and sailors in wartime and peace for over 20 years. I aided humanitarian efforts during the Somali Civil War, and I worked with our allies to shape defense plans for the Republic of Korea. My wife Lynn is also a Marine. We retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 and bought Chicken Bristle Farm, a 75-acre farm plot in Lincoln County.

Together we've raised livestock and developed the largest all-natural and sustainable asparagus operation in central Kentucky. I worked as a substitute teacher in the local school district and as a reporter and editor for the Interior Journal, the third oldest newspaper in our Commonwealth.

I have a deep appreciation, understanding, and respect for the struggles that working families and rural communities endure every day in Kentucky – the kind that only comes from living it. That's why I am running a progressive campaign here in Kentucky that focuses on economic and social justice, with a Universal Basic Income as one of my central policy proposals.

Hi, my name is Garry Cooper and I am the CEO and Co-founder of the resource-sharing company, [Rheaply](https://www.rheaply.com/). Rheaply’s technology accelerates the circular economy by allowing organizations to share idle materials, thus promoting the reuse of assets. Our AxM platform enables companies to share and sell physical assets within and between organizations. AxM serves some of our nation’s most vital institutions: universities, biopharma and biotech companies, major technology companies, and government entities.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rheaply has [partnered](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200522005388/en) with the City of Chicago and World Business Chicago to connect Chicago’s small businesses and nonprofits with personal protective equipment (PPE). In preparation for the reopening of the city, small organizations can use the platform to access hand sanitizer, protective shields, and face masks to protect their staff.

We also developed an adaptation of our core technology that connects healthcare providers and first responders with much-needed PPE and other critical medical supplies.

With these initiatives, we aim to address the supply shortages organizations and healthcare providers face by helping direct these supplies to the places where the need is most dire.

Ask me anything!,,"Excuse the possibly incoherent text. I'm fading in and out due to the amount of morphine I'm on.

I (27M) suffered from a condition called Pectus Excavatum, a defect in the sternum that causes the chest to sink inwards. It can apply pressure to the heart and lungs which can lead to complications with breathing.

The condition is usually treated early on when the defect is first noticed in middle school or highschool (13-15yo)

The cardiologist I saw for the procedure advocated heavily against  corrective surgery when I met with him 14 years ago. The procedure he was aware of involved cutting the sternum, breaking ribs and installing a metal plate.

Many patients who had this procedure done experience chronic pain afterwards and their quality of life decreased
. While I experienced shortness of breath and chest pain during exercise, I weighed the options and decided not to go through with the surgery as I could lead a relatively normal life that I could jeopardize with the procedure.

6 or so years ago I saw an AmA on the front page about a highschool student getting his pectus excavatum corrected with a totally different procedure.

Instead of cutting the ribs and reinforcing with a plate, a minimally invasive procedure is done. The surgeon makes a 4in incision below each armpit. One is used for an endoscope and through the other, a titanium bar with the exact contour if the corrected chest cavity is inserted and rotated into place. This forces the ribs into place from the inside.

At the time I was considering millitary service and after many doctors appointments it was determined that the best course of action for me would be to enlist with a doctors note stating my heart was sound and I was for omit the shortness of breath and chest pain.

Fast forward to last year and I made the decision not to enlist. I also started a job with great health benefits. I spoke with my parents and girlfriend about finally having the surgery done and we all agreed.

I started researching the Nuss procedure

--------

Hi Reddit!

As coronavirus started to spread across the country earlier this year, measuring that spread proved nearly impossible. Without a single source tracking new cases at a granular level, understanding COVID-19’s growth would be difficult.

But gathering the resources to make a tracking map was also difficult. Local governments have disparate methods for collecting and reporting data. For all the numbers on cases and deaths to end up standardized in one place, a bespoke data solution needed to be built from the ground up. USAFacts started making phone calls and scraping data from county websites. The result was one of the first county-level COVID-19 tracker in the US.

The USAFacts Coronavirus Hub is now being used by Dr. Deborah Birx and the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses our data to power the county maps on its own website. Dozens more government entities at all levels use it, and nonprofits like Feeding America consult it to determine where the need for nutritional assistance is greatest.

We are the product team from USAFacts. Ask us anything about aggregating data from hundreds of county, regional, and state governments, plus how our coronavirus data is being used!

My name is Kiarash, nice to meet you all.

When I lost my grandmother, for the first time I realized the importance of voices and how we usually take them for granted, not knowing that one day we might not hear them ever again. I pondered on this question for a long time; how could I possibly come up with an idea to resolve this problem that many people might have. My solution was simple: what if I could preserve voices the way we preserve photographs. What if we could hang voices on a wall? Or print them on T-shirts?

That is when we started [www.soundwaveshop.com](http://www.soundwaveshop.com/) and asked people to upload their recordings on the platform. The website then, converts the audio files to visual images (the same way we can see heart beats on a monitor!)  and then users can order and we print them on T-shirts or canvases. On  each of these prints, there is a Qr code which you can scan to hear your recording. 

Anyways, I know there are many aspiring entrepreneurs outhere with amazing stories of turning their problems into business opportunities and I wanted to share mine. Ask me anything about how to start a business when you are young and have very little money! or anything about the idea!

This time I want people to ask me anything about my recovery in all aspects physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Also how I am able to push forward when everyone told me it would be imposs,,"I was diagnosed with a terminal progressive disease called Toxic Acute Progressive Leukoencephalopathy. This put me into locked in syndrome and hospice for six months.

Here are some facts about what happened:


Memorial Day weekend 2017, I was diagnosed with Acute Toxic Progressive Leukoencephalopathy.  There is no way to prove  what caused my illness.  The only thing they know for sure is that it was from inhaling a toxin.  This disease is nicknamed chasing the Dragon syndrome, I used to smoke heroin on tinfoil, odds are it was a cutting agent.

This is my recovery journey from Locked-in syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma. It is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking.

I will be making video posts as I was getting sicker leading up to me being locked in and then my miraculous recovery.

Everyone thought I was “Brain dead” not in the clinical sense of the term could hear and see the entire time. People thought I would die hundreds of times,  no one has ever recovered from stage four of toxic acute progressive Leukoencephaothy

Here are some key facts about my journey to recovery:

. I was expected to die on New years eve 2017

. I was both completely locked in and in a pseudo-coma for approximately six months

. I survived six months of home care hospice on comfort measures only

. I was fully aware the entire time 

. I slowly showed my first￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ signs of doctors thinking I might be “in there“ By beginning to be able to blink and a minor movement in my right wrist

. In the mid July 2018 I became virtually locked in I could blink for no￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ and stick out my tongue for yes

. In the end of August￼￼ 2018 I became a￼ expert￼ at nonverbal communication with a Megabee 

. January 1, 2019 I began to verbalize vowel sounds

. Shortly there after I started getting mobility back in my arms legs etc.

. July 2019 my entire body was antigravity. I was working on standing and pre-gait activities.  I started communicating in full sentences

I really want to share my story with others going through some more situations both family and patients. If anyone is interested in talking with me please feel free to contact me anytime. Check out my YouTube channel that I created to see how far I’ve come!

I'm Suraj Patel and I'm running for Congress in NY-12 to bring innovative plans to both our nation and my hometown of NYC. A son of immigrants, survivor of COVID, Obama White House alum, and active member of my community, I'm running for Congress to represent a diverse array New Yorkers and Americans and deliver bold ideas to the table. I was the first candidate nationally to devise a [national COVID testing plan](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-to-end-the-pandemic-give-universal-testing-the-green-light/), I believe in a minimum guaranteed income for families, and I firmly advocate for the utilization of science and data in our steps coming out of this pandemic.

Unlike my opponent, I do not take corporate PAC money, I believe in vaccines and evidence-based policies, and I would defend immigrants instead of voting to build walls, as she did in 2006. I am running to restore the promise of New York, which starts with creating programs that allow families and individuals to achieve upwards mobility and embracing our diversity as a city.

When I'm not running for Congress to restore fresh, new plans for our district and country, I am an educator, local business frequenter, activist, and animal lover, who can be found around Tompkins Square Park walking my two lovable dogs, Eli and Peyton.

In late 2019 I was diagnosed with JIA (juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and given anti-inflammatories to manage it. In January 2020 I was diagnosed with the flu, then in February I had strep throat, and in March I got mono and the flu again, only I also had large rashes on my legs/ankles and my eyes were bloodshot 24/7 (i wasn’t a stoner or on any drugs at the time) so I was hospitalized overnight after going to the emergency room about the rashes because they did extensive blood work and found out I had severe anemia and was borderline in kidney failure. Fast forward to the next day, I’m released from the hospital under the condition that we’ll do more testing with my doctors. About a week goes by (this is during the time I had the flu for the 2nd time) and I wake up from a long night of coughing with a large bump on my forehead as if I’d smacked my head on something, but there was no bruising and it was only getting bigger as the morning went on (it was in my hairline stretching to my eyebrow on the entire left side of my forehead) so we sent pictures to my rheumatologist and nephrologist and they contacted me and told me to go to children’s hospital immediately. I’m admitted, get a ct scan and mri of my head, and due to the rashes and testing to find out potentially what it is, a ct scan of my chest. They think I have gpa (granulomatosis with polyangiitis) but will need a kidney biopsy to confirm. But as I’m anemic, I need to get a blood transfusion before they feel safe performing the biopsy. I get the transfusion along with iv steroids for my head, and they determine I’ve recovered from the flu and my blood levels are high enough to perform the biopsy the next day. They perform the biopsy and confirm GPA, and proceed to do blood tests and tests on my lungs to ensure it’s only affecting my kidneys. They did five days of strong iv steroids to try and help my kidneys recover, and the night before I was released they gave me a dose of cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug) to knock out my immune system so it stops attacking my kidneys and joints. At this point they’ve taken me off my medication for arthritis because it’s hurting my kidneys, and I’m not allowed to take any NSAIDS because they’re bad for my kidneys as well. I was in the hospital for the second time a grand total of five days, and I was released with an order to continue doing cytoxan monthly for a total of 6 doses, as well as taking iron supplements and prescription steroids. So far I’ve done 3 out of 6 of my doses and I’ve got the 4th one scheduled. I’m down to 20mg of prednisone every morning (it was 60 when I was released) but the side effects caused me to have significant weight gain. This far into the treatment, I’ve experienced mild hair thinning, and nausea/vomiting the night and morning after the cytoxan. I have to be extremely careful about what I do and where I go especially now with covid-19, because I have a compromised immune system. It made life very difficult for me, but I’m finally starting to be able to see friends again. I’ve felt like an outcast but reading everyone else’s stories here has made me feel less like an anomaly or burden. This is my first time sharing my story on the or anywhere publicly really.

We developed many tools to help combat the COVID-19 crisis, including:

* Painstakingly collating results from over 190+ research papers to create data visualizations that would be helpful to the public/medical community
* Developing a plan for transporting ventilators across the US
* Creating a mortality + infection risk calculator to help doctors know what patients are likely to be more critical, and what patients are likely to actually have COVID-19 (without testing)
* Developing projections and evaluating governmental policies for over 130 countries/regions in the world.

I am in particular in charge of the projections and the policy evaluations around the world. Our projections on April 3rd was that there would be 1M+ *detected* cases by end of May in the US, making us one of the earliest groups to predict with reasonable accuracy.

As protests grow across the country, and police respond with escalating violence, we want to give a voice to those who don't have a platform. Over the coming days and weeks, we want to amplify Black voices who need and deserve to be heard. If you are one of these many, many, many voices, we invite you to do an Ask Me Anything on our subreddit to share it, answer questions from the community, and provide insight to those wanting to listen and learn.

We want to make something very clear: this is not temporary support. We will continue to support the Black Lives Matter movement with AMAs from prominent Black leaders until Reddit folds and we cannot host AMAs on the site anymore. The brutality and systemic racism that Black people face in the United States are the result of a fundamentally broken system — one that supports white people at the expense of those who are not; one that permits those in power to murder Black people and go unpunished; one that does not value the lives of Black people the same way it does the lives of white people.The opposite of racism is not complacency or saying that ""I don't see color;"" it is anti-racism.

The IAmA Team stands in solidarity with the Black community — against police violence, against systemic oppression, and against racism. To that end, we want to share a number of resources  to help those who read our AMAs learn how to be better allies and to be anti-racist. You can find those resources here:

Hi! I'm Lloyd Dabbs, candidate for Florida House District 52 on the Space Coast. 

A native Californian from the agricultural town of Santa Maria, I joined the U.S. Air Force enlisted ranks at the age of 18, earning my officer commission at age 29. I served with distinction for over 20 years – in direct support to every major combat operation since 1998 to include Kosovo, Iraqi Freedom / Inherent Resolve, Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), and United Nations operations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Congo.

The first in his family to attend college, I earned an undergraduate degree in Psychology, a post-graduate degree in counter-terrorism, and two Master’s degrees (Business / Data Analytics and Strategic Intelligence) – graduating with honors in each.

I am running because my wife and I want our children to know we are not powerless in the face of our immense challenges.  Florida is evolving into a progressive state whose citizens demand  comprehensive legislative reforms and real leadership on serious issues.  

We can drive these reforms to deliver affordable healthcare, economic  equality, educational reform, climate activism through an aggressive,  common sense agenda that serves all Floridians. I am running for State  Representative because I truly believe fresh leadership is required to  meet these challenges. 

I am running to keep our community and  state moving forward by addressing our problems head on through a  progressive platform that seeks to unite Floridians in the face of an  uncertain future – because there is more that unites us than divides us.

AMA!,,"**Hi, I’m Jack Sloan. I’m 14 years old, and I’m one of the youngest people working with** [**Masks For Docs**](https://masksfordocs.com/) **to 3D print** [**face shields**](https://i.imgur.com/w2UGYNv) **for healthcare workers. Across the world, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers helping to keep us safe do not have the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) that they need.**

I’m working with Masks For Docs, a not-for-profit organization working to unite Makers around the world to help supply this critical PPE. We have over 5,000 volunteers across the world utilizing a variety of talents to help aid our healthcare workers, such as 3D Printing, Sewing, Designing, Programming, Logistics, Data management, and much more.

Being one of the youngest people in Masks For Docs has given me an amazing opportunity to demonstrate to other teens that we truly can make a difference ourselves, no matter how we do it. We aren’t simply at the mercy of the adults making the decisions, but we can take responsibility and be a part of this.

Using my 3D printer, I’m able to produce the frame parts which go around your head, and I use binding covers for the clear front parts. These face shields protect healthcare workers by preventing any droplets from hitting their faces. They also help keep N95/surgical masks clean, so that they can be reused more safely.

For a brief explanation of how 3D printing works, you can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LBTkLsjHGQ) or [this one](https://youtu.be/1nKX5Vx9DuY?t=84). I became interested in 3D printing about 2.5 years ago after watching some Youtube videos, and learned that the price has dropped greatly in the past few years, meaning printers have become more affordable for the average consumer (you can get a decent one for as low as $200 now).

I’ve been featured on a variety of shows, such as NBC’s Nightly News, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, Great Big Story, and more, which you can see [here](https://linktr.ee/jacksloan).

**Proof**: You can match [this](https://imgur.com/mAJISge) photo with the printers and setup seen in the previous link with the news segments.

I’m happy to answer any questions you may have, whether they're about Masks For Docs, my experience, 3D printing itself, or anything else.

_______________


My passion is to help pet owners and pet pros understand, manage, and modify aggressive behaviors in dogs and my journey over the last two decades in dog training has included working with thousands of clients around the world, serving as past president of the [IAABC](https://m.iaabc.org/) (International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants), and creating educational content about working with aggression cases. My website is [here](https://aggressivedog.com/) and you can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michaelshikashio/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.shikashio) if you want to get notified of the projects I'm involved in.

I have been fortunate to travel all over the globe for the last five years (well, up until the pandemic!) teaching and learning from other dog behavior professionals in more than 100 cities in eight different countries. The journey has been fascinating as I have enjoyed observing the regional differences in dog behavior, and also the culture of dog training in each location, and how they work with aggression cases. One thing that everyone I have met has in common is that we all want to help dogs!

So let’s jump into the topic of aggression in dogs. AMA!

During quarantime I've released the astro-landscape calendar of my dreams and developed a new relaxation website NatureMixer.com. AMA",,"tl;dr just a fellow redditor who quit the rat race to try to make a living through art. My newest projects are a website that allows you to mix together a virtual audio-visual nature scene for relaxation, [www.naturemixer.com](https://www.naturemixer.com), and the ""[best astro-landscape photography calendar ever](https://phil.camera/2021/?bev)"" (according to my mom, anyway). AMA about chasing your crazy dreams (you know you've got 'em)

**Background:**

I'm Phil Mosby. Just an ordinary guy who, at the age of 35, decided to buy a [van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) and a [large format printer](https://i.imgur.com/ZpW3mZm.jpg), quit my comfy job, and attempt to make a living capturing, [printing](https://vimeo.com/258199504), and selling [my astro-landscape photos](https://phil.camera/portfolio/) and [print creations](https://i.imgur.com/Gnjr2Uz.jpg) full time. That was 3.5 years ago, in early 2017, and somehow I'm still kickin' and doing what I love!

In the summer of 2018, thanks in part to Reddit, I was able to [hang one of my hexagon cluster pieces](https://imgur.com/gallery/GSOtioc) on the wall of the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. This was one of the best honors of my life, and the subject of my [last ama](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9d8hsu/im_phil_mosby_almost_2_years_ago_i_quit_my_comfy/).

In 2019 I opened a small [brick and mortar gallery](https://imgur.com/a/nTIktRu) in North Lake Tahoe (including a room for my ""[glowing night](https://i.imgur.com/S2rXT58.mp4)"" prints) ...but fairly quickly found out that retail life is not for me ... and at the end of the year closed the gallery down to re-focus my efforts on my online art sales (which have been my main source of income all along). It was disappointing, but hey, sometimes you gotta try something to find out it's not for you! In the long run it turns out I was extremely lucky on the timing, having focused all of my efforts into my online business months before Covid reared its ugly head.

**Present & Future:**

During this strange quaran-time, I've finally had the mental space to complete two massive projects that have both been on my list for, literally, years:

\#1 ***Nights On Earth*** my 2021 Wall Calendar and Stargazer's Guide to the Night Sky ([preview on Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/GUNcM33)) ([official website](https://phil.camera/2021/)), which is just loaded with [interesting space facts and useful data-points](https://i.imgur.com/ZrVGTLX.jpg) for any stargazer (as well as 13 of my best Lake Tahoe astro-landscape photos, of course). It was a labor of love to compile all this data, but I hope I succeeded in creating something that is beautiful, interesting, *and* incredibly useful to anyone with even a passing interest in space or stargazing (I can't wait to use it myself to plan next year's astro photography!)

...and then for my next feat of massively long days at the computer...

\#2 [**NatureMixer.com**](https://NatureMixer.com) I spent the last two+ months developing Nature Mixer, a website that I have been ""thinking about"" (and shooting video to ""someday"" use for this purpose) for over 5 years.  It allows you to mix together a custom, endlessly-looping, audio-visual naturescape to help you relax, focus, or even fall asleep to. This is another project that I made as much for myself as for anyone else. I use it daily while working and quite often while sleeping (pro-tip, on most phones you can minimize your  browser and the audio will keep playing).  I love this site almost more than anything else I've ever made. I hope you'll check it out and tell me I did good.

**AMA:**

I'm now 38 years old and still have absolutely no idea where I'll be in a year (let alone 5) but I (still) have no regrets about chasing my dreams, and I *believe* I'm currently doing the best work of my life...

AMA about the photo business, print making, selling art online, recklessly chasing your dreams at all costs, calendars, oh and NATUREMIXER of course :) Whatever you want. I'm not necessarily an expert about anything but I might know enough to talk your ear off.

I was taken in by a farmer and stayed with his family for a few months before officially being put up for adoption in an orphanage.

My parents adopted me when I was around 20 months old (I was like a family Christmas present lol) and brought me back to Canada.

I was also born with a clubbed foot and couldn't walk by myself. This led to several surgeries as a kid to rebuild my foot but it ended up not working out in the end and I had a trans-tibial amputation when I was 16.

It's been a long road but I'm excited to be graduating from University this June. I had also completed a program a year previously.

I've done AncestryDNA and I know my estimated ethnicity but I got no hits on close family. I probably won't find out who my birth parents are.

I've been told many times that my story is quite interesting but I mainly wanted to post this AMA for people who are curious about leg amputees but are too afraid to ask in person.

Hi there! I’m Christene Lozano, a sex therapist specializing in compulsive sexual behaviors, sex issues, and relationships. I am a Licensed Marriage & Family Therapist (LMFT), Certified Sex Addiction Therapist (CSAT), and currently in the process of becoming a Certified Sex Therapist (CST).

I wanted to hop on Reddit to host an AMA for National Sex Day (June 9th). We live in a society and culture in which many people are both obsessed with sex and also embarrassed about it. While sex is abundantly advertised in the media, many feel shame and have difficulty talking about sex. Even talking about it with your long-term partner can be hard. From desire, masturbation, and porn, to sexual intimacy, orgasms, and sexual trauma – you and your questions are welcome here.

Due to the topic of sex being uncomfortable for many, please be kind and considerate when asking questions and commenting. Stay curious and non-judgmental. We are a group of diverse cultures, ethnicities, spirituality backgrounds, sexual orientations, sexual experiences, genders, and so forth. What works for one person may not work for another. We want to keep this space safe for everyone.

\**Note to my SA/PA community*: Because this AMA will be hosted in the IAmA sub, there will likely be many non-SA/PA questions and comments. Some folks may have sex and relationship questions you find triggering. Please notice if triggers get stirred up for you and practice some healthy self-care.

**I’ll be here at 12:30pm EDT to answer your sex questions. AMA!**

I may not be able to address every question. Please do not private message me. I will kindly redirect you back to this AMA. Thank you for understanding.

**Disclaimer**: I am not able to provide counseling through Reddit. This is for educational and informational purposes only. Addressing questions does not constitute a therapeutic relationship with me.

I also worked as an intelligence analyst in the Region 13 Counter-Terrorism Fusion Center.

**Breaking Point:**

My breaking point came after the Syria pullout. I called Senator Toomey’s (R-PA) office, got a staffer on the line, and asked him what Toomey’s stance was. I was told that, “the senator disapproves of the pullout.” When I said great, but asked what he was going to do about it, I was flatly told, “Nothing.” *Nothing?* I lost it. A senator’s literal job as defined by the Constitution is to check the balance of the executive branch. If a senator openly admits that he disagrees with a major policy decision like this and does nothing, we have a problem. Toomey, as always, has done zero to check the president’s power. Democracy doesn’t work this way. We’re putting our nation’s system at risk.

This isn’t the party I joined. A new conservative party is needed, but until then it’s time for moderate conservatives to build bridges with democrats.

**What I’m Doing:**

The most important thing any disgruntled conservative can do right now is stand up, be vocal, and give other conservatives social permission to deviate from the norm.

While still a small side project, I started a social media campaign called [“Conservatives Voting Democrat in 2020”](https://www.facebook.com/CVD2020/) to achieve exactly this (click for verification). I reach about 600 people each week, most of whom are conservative. It’s small work but it’s good work.

The “us versus them” mentality in the GOP is real and taking a stand can feel like we’re putting our social ties on the chopping block. Yet hiding doesn’t earn respect - honesty does. If you can say what you believe clearly and directly, back it up with sound argument, and stay calm and grounded throughout, you’re good. If our social ties can’t stand the honest truth then we don’t have great relationships to begin with.

**""But you’re a conservative! Why should conservatives vote democrat?! This makes no sense.""**

I want change. Because disagreement isn’t allowed in the GOP anymore, I’m pretty much forced to do this. This is why many of us resonate with the phrase, ""republican refugees."" We're being forced out.

At the end of the day, the GOP only cares about two things: my money and my vote. I can complain as loud as I want, but if I give them these two things they could care less. Holding my money back won’t do anything; there’s plenty of billionaires to take my place. That leaves me with my vote. If I fall in line and keep voting the way I’ve always voted then I’m only going to get more of the same. I already spent years calling my republican representatives with zero success. This is the only option I have left. It’s the only way to do something that might actually make a difference.

**Why I’m here today:**

1. To answer any questions that could aid in “across the aisle” understanding, and
2. To connect with other disgruntled ""republican refugees"" and let them know that they’re not alone.

We are free individuals who are allowed to vote however we please. These are the rights our nation was built on. It’s time to own our democratic power and use it in the ways we see fit.

We’re two Danish architects who’ve designed a Moon Habitat that can unfold like origami and expand its inner volume by 560%! It’s not ready for the Moon yet, but we’ll test it over 3 months in Arctic Greenland.  We will live like astronauts in total isolation, testing the Habitat, our bodies, and our minds. Essentially, we’re testing ways to make extreme isolation + hostile environments livable for humans, not just military-trained astronauts.

The project is completely independent of any big organizations and we are building the Habitat ourselves here in Copenhagen.

The ultimate goal would be to see our habitat on the surface of the Moon since we believe the future of space travel must not be just survival, but instead that space should be full of life.

Recently, a large (and growing) group of well-meaning moderators expressed their approval for [an open letter to Reddit’s CEO](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gyyqem/open_letter_to_steve_huffman_and_the_board_of/), in which several calls to action were made. The singular theme of this missive was that racism and hate-speech have become entirely too common on the site, and that meaningful steps need to be taken in order to combat them.

While we strongly agree with the spirit of these sentiments, we feel that the proposed approaches are unlikely to achieve anything meaningful… and in many cases, we worry that they will do little more than further empower bad actors. A site-wide comment filter, for example, will be unable to account for the virtually limitless permutations and misspellings (intentional or otherwise) of slurs, and will need to be context-agnostic by default. This technical limitation has been [an open secret](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17550824/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-hate-speech-moderation-nearly-impossible-leaked-chat) for some time now, and is one of the many reasons why human moderators are still essential to Reddit’s communities. 

Despite this, many of those same communities have come together to insist on similar measures being implemented anyway. It bears repeating that we fully support the motivations behind the demand, but feel that the letter itself has effectively forced the administrators to offer one of three unproductive answers. “We can’t” will only further embolden the individuals who are hell-bent on offering vitriol. “We won’t” has already been tried as a means of hiding that inability, and has since been [misinterpreted as a tacit approval of bigotry](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman). That leaves only publicist-approved jargon like “We remain dedicated to fostering an environment of inclusiveness” or “We are making great strides in identifying potential methods of addressing the issue,” both of which will rightly be seen as a flimsy attempts at hand-waving the problem away.

This follow-up – the one you are currently reading – is being written before the above-described open letter has been made public, but we can already predict what it will prompt: First, news outlets will pounce on the original piece, spreading its requests across the Internet. Steve Huffman will then release a statement, and regardless of what he says, he will be further vilified by the media and Redditors alike. If any moderator demands are met (like if a filter is indeed implemented), they will swiftly prove to be ineffectual in the face of organized and systemic hatred, and the accusation will be made that those same countermeasures were intentionally lackluster. In short, a no-win scenario has been unintentionally engineered, and future pleas to the site’s administration will likely fail to attract the same attention.

Something does need to be done, however, especially if the site wishes to survive.

As such, we would like to make our own proposal.

Thousands of moderators oversee an equally large number of communities on Reddit. Contrary to popular belief, these volunteers are practically powerless, having access to only a handful of special privileges within their subreddits (and absolutely none on the site as a whole). Their ability to combat racism, homophobia, incitements of violence, and other such unwelcome content is severely limited, partially by apparent necessity. After all, the individuals in question are not vetted by the administration, and thus cannot be trusted with tools that could be easily misused.

Suppose that a vetting process was put into place, though, and further suppose that some additional abilities were conferred upon those who passed muster. These “trusted moderators” could make use of a back-end system designed to tag problematic users, thus immediately restricting their privileges across the site, removing all of their submissions, and flagging their profiles for administrative review. Perhaps each such tag would need to be assessed by a second “trusted moderator” – one chosen at random – before being applied, thereby ensuring that abuse was all but impossible. Finally, one condition of this “trusted” nature would be absolute anonymity; an agreement that the identities of “trusted moderators” be kept hidden from anyone (even their peers) except for select administrators.

In this way, a ground-up approach could be taken toward reshaping the prevailing culture of the site. The necessary workforce is already present, as is the desire to keep Reddit from sinking further into the pit that seems to be consuming it. The methods for vetting moderators already exist, as well, along with almost all of the basic functionality which would be required by the proposed tool. In short, this would be comparatively easy to implement, and doing so would be an enormous step toward addressing the concerns raised by the open letter to Steve Huffman.

Change does need to happen. It needs to be immediate and effective. The proposals offered by our fellow moderators may have seemed idealistic, but the motivation behind them was (and remains) completely sound.

We understand, administrators of Reddit, that you have been placed in a difficult situation… but if you accept our help, we can use it as an opportunity. To that end, we are providing you with an actionable, feasible, and productive method of combating vitriol and violence on the site. Embrace the resources already at your disposal, and you’ll be able to avoid the current necessity of offering one of those dreaded three answers.

“We can’t,” “We won’t,” and “We will” simply will not work this time.

I'm Michelle Burrows, a civil rights attorney based out of Portland, Oregon. I've spent the last 30 years suing police, police departments, and the prison systems for widespread abuse of people and misuse of power. 

I'm well known for cases like Anstett v. State of Oregon, a prisoner class action for the non-treatment of Hepatitis C in the Oregon prison system. As a result, we entered into a stipulated agreement which enforced new standards and protocols for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Hep C in the prison systems. The outcome also included a multi-year monitoring system with a federal supervisory judge to verify that the parties followed through. 

Another important landmark case for Oregon was Kaady v. City of Sandy and Clackamas County. Where two officers tazed and shot Mr. Fouad Kaady in the back multiple times while he was naked, covered in third degree burns, and looking for help after his car caught fire through mechanical failure. The law firm of Gerry Spence approached me to be local council where we won a substantial settlement and were able to change the scope of what constitutes lethal force in Oregon. This case was fundamental in classifying tazers as lethal force in the state of Oregon and was instrumental in changing public perception of use-of-force in Oregon.  

More recently I represented Lisa Dunn v. City of Eugene for systematic rape, abuse, and kidnapping by an on duty police officer over the course of five years. The city police department ignored the indiscretions and allowed the abuse to continue unchecked. We sued and won. The officer was sentenced to 90 years and Lisa was monetarily compensated, although that won't make up for years of abuse. 

My son is helping me with this AMA because I don't know how to use the internet.

About Dr. Sasson: I’m a Denver-based emergency room doctor who recently spent a month in New York City caring for patients with COVID-19 at a temporary hospital at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. While serving there, I continued my work alongside the American Heart Association as vice president for emergency cardiovascular care science and innovation. The COVID-19 crisis has presented new and unique challenges in performing emergency cardiovascular care that have required quick, science-based solutions and guidance for health care professionals and the public around the world. 

About Dr. Topjian: I am a Philadelphia-based pediatric critical care medicine physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I also serve as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pediatrics at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The American Heart Association encourages the public to call 911, especially if they or a loved one may be having a stroke or heart attack. A new cause for concern during the pandemic is that fewer people are calling 911. It’s important to remember that hospitals are still the safest place to be if you are having a heart attack or a stroke. Don’t hesitate or doubt: Call 911 at the first sign of a heart attack or stroke. 

We’ll be answering your questions on how COVID-19 has affected patient and resuscitation care, interim CPR guidance during COVID-19, and ways hospitals are adjusting and treating non-COVID patients safely. Dr. Sasson can also discuss her time caring for COVID-19 patients in New York City. Ask us Anything!

Ask me anything about dissenting while on active duty and pushing the limits of free speech under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.,,"Hi y'all. My name is Ronn Cantu and I publicly spoke out against the Iraq War while on active duty with the United States Army. I was threatened with legal charges, received death threats, someone online even called me fat :'( 

At the time, they told us we were fighting for freedom but I thought that was a bald-faced lie. More than fifteen years later and law enforcement all over the country has proved it was. They told us that it was better to fight the terrorists ""over there rather than over here"" and now look where we are.

In 2006, I couldn't convince other soldiers that the rights I was flexing were their rights too.

This past week, an Army regional commander--a 4-star general--sent an email to everyone under his command an affirmation that soldiers do have the right to ""participate in off-post demonstrations in the United States when they are off-duty, out of uniform, when their activities do not constitute a breach of law and order and when violence is not likely to result.""

The general went on to specify ""My general order prohibits social and recreational gatherings.  I do not view those who want to exercise their first amendment rights as engaged in a social or recreational gathering. ""

This. Is. Huge. The general is tacitly giving all soldiers under his command permission to take to the streets in order to speak directly to their civilian leadership!

The general is obviously correct but his email didn't go far enough. In addition to having the right to participate in off-post demonstrations, active-duty servicemembers have the right to speak to media and voice their dissent provided they don't use slanderous language against anyone high up in their chain-of-command (anyone with stars on their uniform or ""secretary"" in their title and definitely not the Commander-in-Chief).

I will caveat this to mention that the Army picks and chooses the charges it brings forward. I did a radio interview with an active-duty soldier who absolutely called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney ""liars"" and I'm friends with an active-duty NCO who publicly spoke out against the war IN UNIFORM. Neither were punished.

In the interview I talk about in the below clip, I was not off-duty, nor out-of-uniform, nor off-post, and I wasn't punished. 

All of us were honorably discharged.

These are the times when heroes identify themselves and right now the country could use a hero if not a thousand.

Ask me anything! :)

I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old medical student taking a leave of absence to run for the U.S. House of Representatives because the establishment has totally failed us. The only thing they know how to do is to think small. But it’s that same small thinking that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We all know now that we can’t keep putting bandaids on our broken systems and expecting things to change. We need bold policies to address our issues at a structural level.

We've begged and pleaded with our politicians to act, but they've ignored us time and time again. We can only beg for so long. By now it's clear that our politicians will never act, and if we want to fix our broken systems we have to go do it ourselves. We're done waiting.

I am running in Michigan's 12th congressional district, which includes Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Dearborn, and the Downriver area.

I am running as a progressive Democrat, and my four main policies are:

1.	A Green New Deal 
2.	College for All and Student Debt Elimination 
3.	Medicare for All 
4.	No corporate money in politics 

I also support abolishing ICE, universal childcare, abolishing for-profit prisons, and standing with the people of Palestine with a two-state solution.

Due to this Covid-19 crisis, I am fully supporting www.rentstrike2020.org. Our core demands are freezing rent, utility, and mortgage payments for the duration of this crisis.

Hello Reddit, it's nice to be back again to answer another round of awesome questions from you all. I have done 3 othet AmAs over the last 10 years and I figured its about time for another. 

To make a long story short, I was hit with a power line. It's a pretty shocking story that ends with me getting a full face transplant. 

I was a passenger in a pickup truck and the driver lost control around an S turn, hitting a utility pole. When the female passenger came in contact with one of the downed lines, I apparently tried and succeeded in saving her life, only to be hit with the same line. I was hit with 10,000 volts, 7 amps for 5 mins. The electricity entered my left leg, went through my body, and exited my face. I suffered a left below knee amputation, minor and major electrical blowouts throughout my body, in full thickness burns to the face.

I've had over 67 reconstruction surgeries on my face, multiple done on my body, and finally a full face transplant. Altogether I had over a hundred surgeries!

It's been 20 years since the accident and almost 10 years since the face transplant - ask me anything you want Reddit I'm an open book.
