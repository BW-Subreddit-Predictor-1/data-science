0,fjt707,AskScience Meta Thread: COVID-19 and reaching people in a time of uncertainty,,"Hello everyone! We thought it was time for a meta post to connect with our community. We have two topics we'd like to cover today. Please grab a mug of tea and pull up a comfy chair so we can have a chat.

---

**COVID-19**

First, we wanted to talk about COVID-19. The mod team and all of our expert panelists have been working overtime to address as many of your questions as we possibly can. People are understandably scared, and we are grateful that you view us as a trusted source of information right now. We are doing everything we can to offer information that is timely and accurate. 

With that said, there are some limits to what we can do. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this virus and the disease it causes. Our policy has always been to rely on peer-reviewed science wherever possible, and an emerging infectious disease obviously presents some major challenges. Many of the questions we receive have been excellent, but the answers to them simply aren't known at this time. As always, we will not speculate. 

We are also limiting the number of similar questions that appear on the subreddit. Our panelists are working hard to offer in-depth responses, so we are referring people to similar posts when applicable. 

To help, we have compiled a few /r/AskScience resources:

- [The COVID-19 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/medicine/2019-ncov): This is part of our larger FAQ that has posts about a multitude of topics. We are doing our best to update this frequently.

- [COVID-19 megathread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/) and [COVID-19 megathread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/): Lots of questions and answers in these threads.

- [New COVID-19 post flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27covid-19%27&sort=top&restrict_sr=on): We've added a new flair category just for COVID-19. You can filter on this to view only posts related to this topic. We are currently re-categorizing past posts to add to this. 

- We will continue to bring you new megathreads and AMAs as we can.

Of course, all this comes with the caveat that this situation is changing rapidly. Your safety is of the utmost importance, and we'd like to remind you not to take medical advice from the internet. Rely on trusted sources like the WHO and CDC, check in with your local health department regularly, and please follow any advice you may receive from your own doctor.

---

**AskScience AMAs**

Second, we wanted to discuss our AMA series a bit. As you know, many schools have either cancelled classes or moved to online learning. This presents a unique set of challenges for students and teachers alike. Many of our expert panelists also teach, and they are working extremely hard to move their courses online very quickly.

We are putting out a call for increased AMAs, with the goal of giving as many students as possible the opportunity to interact directly with people who work in STEM fields. This goes for all disciplines, not just those related to COVID-19. We typically host scientists, but we have also had outstanding AMAs from science authors and journalists. 

As always, we plan only schedule one AMA per day, but we will be making an effort to host them more frequently. To aid in this process, we've [created a website for interested parties to use to contact us]( https://sites.google.com/view/askscienceamas/). 

We schedule AMAs well in advance, so don't hesitate to contact us now to set something up down the line. If you'd like to do an AMA with your research team, that's great, too (group AMAs are *awesome*).
If you're a student or science educator, please keep an eye on the calendar in the sidebar! As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail with questions or comments.

To kick things off, we'd like to cordially invite to join us for an **AMA with author Richard Preston on March 17**. He is the author of a number of narrative nonfiction books, including *The Hot Zone*, *The Demon in the Freezer*, and *Crisis in the Red Zone*.

1,hby8jr,How much did fishes adapt to fishing?,,"We as humans practice fishing for a very long time, and very intensively recently, so I wonder how can fishes still got tricked by the hooks and baits (even though most of fishing today is not with that method) So, are there fish species that significantly changed their behavior in response to fishing? And which one?",,213,askscience
2,hc75oc,What exactly is the lymphatic system for and what are it‚Äôs evolutionary origins?,,"I‚Äôve always learned answers such as ‚Äúit‚Äôs important for the immune system‚Äù and also that it aids in fat transport. However, it seems excessive to have a separate vessel system just for those purposes, when the circulatory system is generally adequate for most immune response and nutrient circulation. How did the lymphatic system evolve and remain present? Did it once hold greater importance? How bad would it be if someone didn‚Äôt have it?",,16,askscience
3,hc22md,"If something bleaches, where does the colour go?",,"When something gets bleached, where does the colour go?
For example plastic toys or printed posters that lose their colour when exposed to the sun, as well as chemical bleached things such as hair or fabrics.",,20,askscience
4,hc73fp,"Is carrying antibiotic resistance genes costly for bacteria? In other words, is there any selection pressure against having them?",,,,8,askscience
5,hc3myj,"Which is more efficient, high or low altitude flight?",,"I know nothing about this but I was just considering air density and flight. I think low altitude has higher density air which would make more friction on a fuselage and slow an aircraft down BUT the engines would have more thrust/material to push. In very high altitude there would be less friction but also less air/material for the engines to push so they might have to work harder to go the same speed? I suspect that it might depend on what speed an aircraft wants to go. Also, getting to altitude might remove any efficiency advantage of high altitude flight.  Think Solar Impulse versus the X-15. Which is more efficient, very high or very low fight?",,8,askscience
6,hc8cok,Why is there a high tide in the opposite side to the moon?,,"It makes sense why there would be a high tide facing the moon, because the moon's gravity pulls the water. But why a high tide on the opposite tide, therefore 2 high tides a day?",,2,askscience
7,hbth40,What mediates a salmon's ability to return to it's home river?,,"Is the instinct to return to their home river encoded in their DNA, or in their early memories? For example, if I took salmon eggs laid in river A and transplanted them in river B, which river would they return to?",,36,askscience
8,hc2flc,"How does the doppler effect not violate conservation of momentum? Is this a dark energy, negative vacuum pressure thing?",,"Not a physics major.  Just watch a lot of Matt O'Dowd(üëç).

Photon momentum is a function of frequency.  If a photon's 
frequency is different between two observers in receding galaxies, where did that momentum energy go?

Does it bleed into some fundamental field?
Does dark energy's stretching of spacetime warp the waveform?
Does it mean there really is a prime reference frame and photon energies are only observed to be different because of relativistic Doppler effects?",,4,askscience
9,hc5npl,"Can someone who has had Covid-19, and built up immunity, still spread the virus via respiratory droplets?",,Let‚Äôs say you get exposed again after building immunity. Is there a period where the virus is able to spread before your immune system can kill it?,,0,askscience

11,hbpd0q,"Questions on Newton's 3rd law: when I push on a wall, how does it push back on me? I just don't understand what is happening at the particle level when push a wall thar causes it to push back on me. Same goes with an object on a table, how does the table actually push back on the object?",,,,14,askscience
12,hbgzjc,When does a human become capable of recognizing their own reflection?,,"As the question suggests, I‚Äôm just curious on how and when a person starts to recognize themselves in a mirror, and how does it compare to animals, for example?",,57,askscience
13,hbss0g,Does the engine placement on a plane affect how steep the plane can take off?,,"I know there are a lot of factors involved in this such as the wind, weight of the plane, and the design of the plane itself but imagine two planes, one with engines on the tail (MD-80 series) vs. one with engines on the wings (737s or A320s), taking off at an identical takeoff situation. Which plane might be able to take off at a steeper angle?",,7,askscience
14,hbkera,"Since heat transfer is caused by random collision of particles, is it mathematically possible that your hand could touch a hot pan and you actually heat up the pan with your hand?",,"I know the probability of this would be inconceivably small so it would never actually happen, but is it mathematically possible that: because heat transfer is based on random collisions of particles, all the hot particles just so happen to bounce from your hand to a hot so that the net heat transfer is positive? This would mean that instead of the pan heating up your hand, your hand transfers even more heat to the pan.

Sorry if I'm misunderstanding physics, just a fun question I thought of.",,18,askscience
15,hbw3v9,How fast could you go if you built a railgun straight through the Moon?,,If the Moon is 3500Km‚Äôs across and assuming that you had 200Gw available (1Gw nuclear plant every 100Kms with efficiency losses) and 1 ton of mass?

18,hblbz3,Does docking with the international space station affect its orbit?,,I would imagine it would have to - what I'm really curious about is whether or not it is enough of an impact that an adjustment has to be made after docking in order to keep the ISS in a stable orbit,,5,askscience
19,hbtvul,How did covid-19 enter the first person to infect them?,,"From what‚Äôs all understanding I have, it would be unlikely that the first case was from someone eating a bat.  Is it that maybe it comes from something else they had eaten that was infected?",,1,askscience
20,hbd7cz,"Are there any ""living clades"" (2 or more species whose last common ancestor is not extinct)?",,"I can't think of any... it could happen, right?

Oh and ""living clade"" is apparently a meaninglyes term that I've just made up, which is probably why I can't google it! And maybe I'm using it wrong anyway, unless I'm also going to insist that ALL the descendents of the last common ancestor are still with us.

24,hbefvq,Why are Irradiated Objects Radioactive for so Long??,,"I‚Äôm watching the Chernobyl docuseries for the first time and am not fully grasping the concept of radiation exposure. 

It seems that a lot of the land around Chernobyl has seen reduced radiation over time to where tourists can come and visit the area (for limited periods of time). 

But the Pripyat Hospital basement is still incredibly dangerous from the piles of engineer and fireman clothes who were working that night some 30+ years ago. 

There are even videos on YouTube - https://youtu.be/pzjtJNu-jYM - of people touring the basement with Geiger counters, showing the radiation being emitted from those items. 

Please explain to me like I‚Äôm a 6 year old:

- Why/how do irradiated objects then themselves emit their own radiation? (if that is even what is happening)
- Why are objects/soil on the surface (that were in close proximity to the core explosion) seemingly ‚Äúsafer‚Äù 30+ years later, while worker‚Äôs clothes are still dangerous?
- Is there a simple way to explain radiation and its effects in high doses (more so on objects than people)?

27,hb1t5i,How quickly does a person infected with a virus become infectious themselves?,,"Current times got me thinking... If there were a stadium with 50,000 people in attendance for 2 hours and one of them had a virus and was infectious, presumably that person would infect a number of people around them. But how quickly would those newly infected people become infectious themselves? By the end of the 2 hours, how many of the 50,000 would we expect to be infected?",,26,askscience
28,hb1tdt,Is there any way to know what the Earth's rotational speed might have been prior to the collision with Theia that is theorized to have formed the Moon? And is there any chance the Earth ever experienced tidal locking/synchronous rotation with the Sun?,,I've seen writing that suggests that the Theia may have significantly increased the speed of the earth's rotation.

30,hax8eu,Did the nuclear bomb (testing) and the subsequent increase in background radiation levels lead to an increase in cancer?,,"I found out today that some experiments require low-background steel, i.e. steel forged before the nuclear bomb, as steel forged after this period is contaminated with airborne radionuclides.   This led me to wonder whether the increase in background radiation had an appreciable effect on cancer rates in the global population, but I couldn't find any information on this.",,13,askscience
31,hb1kz6,How does sonar work?,,"I get that sonar is a device that emits sound waves and then collects their reflection and records the time taken in order to calculate the distance an object is from the source, but how does the device ensure that it will collect the sound wave upon reflection. For example if there was a smooth plane in front of the emitter, only a couple sound waves would return to the emitter upon reflection. Also how does a sonar distinguish one emitted wave from another?",,7,askscience

It seems to me that  the transition to freshwater would have been easier than that to land, and likely earlier, but it may be that fossils are less easily preserved in rivers, lakes and streams.

The satellite will be accelerated prograde and radial out, when it's on the way to its apoapsis. This would raise the apoapsis (and the periapsis slightly, due to increased velocity?), but also accelerate retrograde and radial out, when the satelite passed the apoapsis (which would lower the periapsis again?). So the net energy wouldn't change, but due to the radial out acceleration, the orbit will have a slight bulge on the Moon side and therfore a lower periapsis. 

Would this effect increase with each orbit, resulting in the satelite crashing into Earth again (while slightly rotating the apoapsis with the Moon's orbit) ?

Or would the apoapsis and periapsis stay the same and the elliptic orbit just rotates around with the Moon?

However when we say, ""marine species"" or, ""life"" are scientists referring exclusively to macroscopic or even multicellular life, or does this include microscopic life, bacteria, protozoans, etc.?

I have always assumed that this is was scientific communication shorthand. Surely, I figured, not 96% of all living organisms from all branches of the tree of life, could have been wiped out. For starters the archaeological evidence of bacterium must be inadequate to assign a significant mapping of genera (let alone species), and thus deduce a rate of extinction for most microscopic life...

Or am I wrong, and these types of expressions should be taken at face value?

60,hairfo,Why do planetary gears rations not seem to follow the normal rear reduction rules?,,"No idea if this is the correct sub for this but I figure it cant hurt to ask.  I'm pretty good with physics and science IMO and I figured for fun I'd try to teach myself about planetary gearboxes because they're pretty cool and a bit more complicated than regular gears.

So I 3D printed a little gear I made with a 60 tooth ring gear, with a 30 tooth sun gear and two 15 tooth planet gears.  When you do the math for this particular gearbox (using equations I found online), it says for one full rotation of the sun gear, the planets should move about 1/3 of the way around the circle, essentially a 3:1 reduction, and this is how it works with the model I printed; but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around where the 3 comes from.

I would think that if I spin the sun gear one full rotation (30 teeth) it would force the planets to also spin a distance of 30 teeth, or half way around the circle.  But when you look up close you can see that with one full rotation of the sun gear, 20 teeth mesh between the sun and the planet, getting us the 20/60 or 1/3 rotation that the equations predict.  So obviously the math is right and I am just visualizing it wrong.  I can see if I instead twist the ring and watch the center gear it will twist twice to the outer gears one turn, which makes sense in my head for the two to one.  So really what still doesn't make sense is where the 3 to 1 comes from when you hold the ring gear stationary and drive the sun.  Can anyone explain why its not working the way my head seems to think it should work? Or is this there a better sub to ask?

Recently, the spacecraft - which is more than four billion miles from home and speeding toward interstellar space - took images of the stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 from its unique vantage point in deep space. Scientists combined these images with pictures of the same stars taken near the same time from Earth, creating stereo images that instantly demonstrate the parallax effect astronomers have long used to measure distances to stars. New Horizons is humankind's farthest photographer, imaging an alien sky. Why does New Horizons ""see"" these stars in a different place in the sky than on Earth? How are these images sent back from New Horizons? How long does it take the team on the ground to send commands to the spacecraft? Where is New Horizons headed next?

124,h7ruvz,Can a linear dynamical system undergo a Hopf bifurcation?,,"Another way to state the question: Can Hopf bifurcations exist without limit cycles?

Conceptually I always see a Hopf bifurcation as having two main features: loss of stability of a fixed point and either the generation or loss of a limit cycle (stable/unstable for the sub/supercritical cases respectively).

However, I usually see the Hopf bifurcation formally defined as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis.

This formal definition suggests a linear system such as z'=(a+i)z (where z is complex) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at a=0.

However, linear systems cannot have limit cycles. Is the existence of a limit cycle required for a Hopf bifurcation? And if not, is the process of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis a sufficient condition to guarantee the presence of a limit cycle in a nonlinear system (i.e. can you have nonlinear systems which undergo a Hopf without the presence of a limit cycle, and if so why do we almost always see Hopf bifurcations alongside limit cycles)?

My go to book for this type of thing is Kuznetsov's Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory, which does address this linear case (Remark 4 in section 3.4), but I struggled to get a straight answer as to whether or not the linear case can actually be defined to undergo a Hopf bifurcation.

>Given their proximity, the red dwarf star's gravitational pull actually distorts the pulsations of the larger star. This causes the larger star to be distorted into more of a teardrop shape, rather than the usual sphere.

The excerpt from the article that intrigued me. Shouldn't the shape of the Red Dwarf be distorted too, considering the ""larger"" star has more mass than the Red Dwarf?

I initially thought it was a question of ""density"" but later read that if the Sun were replaced by a Black Hole of the same mass, then nothing would change in the Solar System, in terms of orbit and otherwise.

I suppose it's probably limited to primates in general if it exists at all in other species. I just found it interesting because it's an extremely specific adaptation.

>Tests producing so few false positives may sound promising, but any test‚Äôs efficacy is dependent upon its accuracy and the prevalence of the disease in the population ‚Äî **the lower the prevalence, the greater the chance is that a test result will be wrong. For example, if only 5 percent of the country‚Äôs population has been infected over the past three months, a test kit that is 95 percent specific will produce five true positives and five false positives,** meaning any result has only a 50 percent chance of being accurate. In that scenario, even a test with 99 percent specificity would produce false positives 17 percent of the time.

I'm having trouble understanding this concept.  Isn't the accuracy of a test simply a ratio of the estimated number of likely false results to the total number of tests given?  How can a test's accuracy vary with the factual probability of the outcome being tested?

So why to WBCs not cause this same problem? By most estimates, some WBC's are 2-3x the size of red blood cells. Is it something in their chemical composition? Or is it simply related to their inability to clot with each other, even when we have increase WBC numbers (such as during an infection)?

I think all of this makes sense but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration) says something about accelerometers only measuring *proper acceleration*, and gravity is responsible for *coordinate acceleration*. Is proper acceleration only caused by actual physical forces? Then what causes coordinate acceleration, and why/how does gravity cause it?

Also, since GTR tells us that objects in regions of curved spacetime move along curved paths (geodesics), would that count as acceleration? (Since the object's direction is changing even if velocity is constant similar to an object in uniform circular motion). If yes, then is Newtonian Gravity actually trying to explain that ""acceleration"" using a ""force"" because non-Euclidean geometries and curved space, let alone spacetime as concepts didn't exist back then?",,1,askscience
212,h0iega,How does armor penetration work?,,"I'm a fan of both sci fi and military history (especially tank warfare) but something that has always eluded me is the relationships between projectile mass and velocity on armor penetration.

Example
Lets take the famous .50 BMG sniper rifle round. Basic research gave me the following: (subject to variance depending on round type)

Mass: 45 g 
Muzzle Velocity: 900 m/s
Penetration: roughly 30 mm rolled homogenous armor (RHA) at close range 90 degree impact. Thats over an inch of steel in freedom units so not too shabby!

What would the RHA penetration be in the following scenarios holding all else constant?

A) Double bullet mass (90 g and 900 m/s)
B) Double bullet velocity (45 g and 1800 m/s)

These scenarios both double the momentum but only A doubles the energy, so heres a bonus:

C) Double energy thru velocity (45 g  and 1273 m/s)

Final points:
For A, I'm assuming the way you go about doubling the bullet mass matters. How would a bullet with double the density fare against one thats simply twice as long?

Also I am aware that modern propellants cant get a bullet to 1800 m/s. That being said, magnetic railguns or new plasma/liquid propellents could which makes it interesting to consider.

A common analogy to explain galaxy arms is cars slowing down to look at an accident on the side of the road. There is always a clump of cars near the accident, but cars constantly move into and out of the clump. I don't like this analogy because I would think that stars would speed up, not slow down, as they approach the density wave because of the gravitational attraction between that star and the density wave. Similarly, I would think that a star moving out of the density wave would slow down for the same reason. If this were the case, I would expect galaxy arms to quickly fade into a more uniform disc, but we know this to not be the case. What am I missing here?",,6,askscience

- Does the antibody have to be a peptide/protein? Or could it for example be a complex sugar?

- Are the antibodies always produced as part of a person's or animal's normal immune system? Or could they come from completely random sources - e.g. could, say, haemoglobin just magically happen to inhibit a virus? 

- Are we looking for potential antibodies only in humans, or also animals/plants? What determines where we look?

I believe he said this  at the time because the fumes  of the solution may have been hazardous  or the solution may splash if we  blow too hard.

Thoughts:  The  sides of mugs usually have a bigger surface area than the  top of  the hot beverage. Via conduction, my thoughts are that the  heat  should disperse into the mug quite rapidly. Additionally, if the  hot beverage is stirred, the surface area touching the sides of the mug is  even more  significant.

Personally, I feel blowing the top of the mug has always been better because I feel the heat escaping as I blow but I'm not sure if this means it's actually better than blowing the sides.

Also, possible variables to consider is stirring and if this would change the outcome, and for the sake of having a clearer direction for this question, lets say the mug is ceramic and holds approximately 250ml (just imagine a typical white mug with a handle).",,45,askscience

We were also taught why this is. As we move to the right the outer shell of the atom fills up, and the fuller the outer shell the easier it would be to fill up the shell by adding electrons and the more intensly it will attract electrons. The move we move upwards the smaller the atoms become, the closer their outer shells are to the positively charged core and the bigger the pull the core is able to excert.

I understand E represents energy, usually potential energy, but what unit is E measured in?

If it‚Äôs constant, what is the correct unit to use for each variable?

For example, take a 5 kg object. Multiply by the speed of light (defined in this case as 299,792,458 m/s), squared, (8.987551787368e16 m/s), which gives us 4.493775893684e17. What unit is this number measured in? 

What makes the speed of light relavent to measuring energy in objects with mass? If light is made up of photons, and photons have a mass of 0, that would make the energy of photons equal to 0 according to this equation.

AMA!",,"I earned my undergrad degree in astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, and then I did my PhD in astronomy at Cornell University in 2005. I specialize in the orbital dynamics of solar system bodies, using their present orbit to figure out their past history. I usually use computer simulations, and my job involves quite a bit of programming. Back in graduate school I discovered the BYORP effect, which is driven by solar radiation and which changes the orbits of small binary asteroids very quickly (astronomically speaking). In 2012, Sarah Stewart and I had a paper in Science where we proposed that Earth was spinning very fast when the moon-forming collision happened, which made it possible to make the moon from Earth's material. My part was to show how Earth could lose excess spin afterwards through complex interactions between the Sun and the Moon. In 2016, I revisited this issue and found that early Earth was probably not only spinning super fast but also had a large axial tilt. I have also worked on the dynamics of Saturn's moons, and I proposed in 2016 that Saturn's inner moons and rings are probably only about 100 million years old. Cassini spacecraft results later suggested this is indeed the case, at least for the rings. My latest paper is on the past orbits of Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and how the orbit of Deimos makes sense only if Mars had a large ring about 3 billion years ago.

\- Are they objectively detrimental and just a direct consequence of the damage sustained by the chromatin . Alterations that would cause rejuvenation if reversed ?

\- Do they result of an adaptation to ageing : purpously methylating promoters to reduce activity, thus limiting aberrant proteins / cancer ? ( for example testosterone / estrogene reduction could be viewed as a way for the body to limit cancer risk )

Since velocity is a function of time, and time in affected by relative velocities, would an object under constant acceleration appear to an observer to non accelerate in a linear fashion?

As the object moves faster and faster, would the time dilation produce an effect where the object, moving in its own relative field, experiences the same acceleration, but from out outside perspective, due to a comparitively slower time dilation, see the object as accelerating faster and faster, in a third derivative of position sense.

What are the limitations or engineering reasons why you don't see at this moment, Intel or AMD releasing CPUs with massive core counts and also massive clock speeds?

However, I've got a few problems with that answer:

* In **osteogenesis imperfecta**, patients are described as having 'blue sclera' because of a thinning of the sclera, making the underlying choroidal blood vessels visible. There is *no skin* over these blood vessels, but a thin sclera.
* In **open surgeries** (like in an open heart surgery), you can see the veins as looking sort of dark-purplish.

In these contexts, are the overlying tissues (the sclera and, I guess, the adventitia of the veins) responsible for the blue discoloration by having the same scattering effects as the skin? How does this scattering effect come about, and how come pretty much all human tissues have those same properties?

Also, from what I searched online, people mainly seemed to focus on the distinction between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. But what about carbaminohemoglobin? I've seen some sources say carbaminohemoglobin has a 'distinctive blue color'. First off, is that true? If I took a blood sample, put it in a closed container, and then somehow got rid of all the O2 and replaced it with carbon dioxide, would the sample start becoming purplish-blue? If so, does that also play a role in the blue color of veins, or of the skin and mucosae of a cyanotic patient?

I know the question of 'why are veins blue' has probably been asked a lot, but I really haven't found any satisfying answers, especially in the case of osteogenesis imperfecta (which is what brought me to start researching this subject).

That is where this question originally came from, but I think I found a possible answer that I will address in a second. 

The main example I'm questioning is a regular propane grill, I don't understand how the fire doesn't run back up the fuel line and blow up the tank. It seems like the gas is coming out slow enough that this would be possible.

I have seen videos of people spraying hair spray and lighting it on fire, then the whole can explodes. How does this happen, but my propane tank doesn't explode on my grill?

In regards to the SpaceX rockets, my uneducated assumption is that the fuel is coming out of the pumps into the combustion chamber at such high speeds that the only way the flames can go is out.

SARS-CoV-2 can enter T-cells and release its RNA, but it fails to replicate. In other cells, host cell ribosomes will take viral RNA and synthesize proteins from it, beginning the process of viral replication, but for some reason(s) this does not appear to happen in infected T-cells.

492,grhn03,AskScience AMA Series: Hello Reddit! We're a group of climate researchers and engineers working on new technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Ask us anything!,,"We're Nan Ransohoff and Ryan Orbuch from the Climate team at **Stripe**. Our work to mitigate the threat of climate change focuses on an underexplored part of the problem-removing carbon from the atmosphere directly, which is essential if the world is to meet its warming targets. Last week, after a rigorous search and review from independent scientific experts, we [announced](https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases) Stripe's first purchases from four negative emissions projects with great potential. We hope this will help create a large and competitive market for carbon removal. 

**CarbonCure**: I'm Rob Niven, Founder and CEO of [CarbonCure Technologies](https://www.carboncure.com/). Our technology chemically repurposes waste CO_2 during the concrete manufacturing process by mineralizing it into calcium carbonate (CaCO_3)-reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering material costs, and improving concrete quality. The technology is already being used at 200+ concrete plants from Miami to Singapore to build hundreds of construction projects from highrises to airports.

**Charm Industrial**: We're Kelly Hering and Shaun Meehan, founding engineers at [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/). We have created a novel process for converting waste biomass into bio-oil, which we then inject deep underground as negative emissions-creating a permanent geologic store for carbon. 

**Climeworks**: I'm Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of [Climeworks](https://www.climeworks.com/). We use renewable geothermal energy and waste heat to capture CO_2 directly from the air, concentrate it, and permanently sequester it underground in rock formations. 

**Project Vesta**: We're Eric Matzner and Tom Green from [Project Vesta](https://projectvesta.org/). Project Vesta captures CO_2 by using an abundant, naturally occurring mineral called olivine. Ocean waves grind down the olivine, which captures atmospheric CO_2 from within the ocean and stabilizes it as limestone on the seafloor.

The researchers think these cells were likely triggered by past infection with one of the four human coronaviruses that cause colds; proteins in these viruses resemble those of SARS-CoV-2.

Regarding previous exposure to human coronaviruses, [NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63) looks awfully similar to COVID-19 because they both attack via the ACE2 receptor.

528,gqxvrm,Why doesn't the CDC provided Oligonucleotide Sequences provided for Covid-19 testing match any sub-sequences provided in the updated published Covid-19 genome (version 2)?,,"I have been investigating the Covid-19 testing process and more specifically how the tests were created.

From my understanding, the CDC has published Oligonucleotide Sequences ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)) that should be used by US RT-PCR test creators to detect the presence of Covid-19. From my understanding, these published sequences are the signatures for detection of the virus.

In trying to understand how these sequences were created, I took the original published sequenced genome ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2)) published in the ""Chinese Medical Journal"" and tried to find the provided CDC sequence as it is my assumption that the CDC published sequences should match the original covid-19 sequenced genome. I was able to successfully find the first provided forward primer ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT""  matching the end of line number 28261.

However, the scientists have updated the genome with a new version on Jan 17, 2020 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)) and I am unable to find the sequence ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT"" in this Covid-19 genome. I have also checked the reverse (CTG GGG TTT ...) without luck.

I would assume the entire point of picking good Oligonucleotide Sequences is they should stay static over all possible Covid-19 changes. The CDC clearly says it may change these sequences but they haven't. How is this possible to have a different published Covid-19 genome that the CDC's test doesn't detect? Isn't the fact the genome was updated problematic? Could the CDC test ""verified"" test not actually be effective as a result? Did the CDC do it's own large scale sequencing effort since the first sequence was collected from only 5 individuals.",,6,askscience

Does the body develop and maintain the memory cells for an extended period of time, with these continuously pumping out antibodies with the specific surface receptors just in case reinfection occurs, or is there an ""oh shit"" moment wherein the body has to look through its ""immunity catalogue"" to then produce the required antibodies?

What I""m finding in lay-understandable sources seems to suggest that accessory spleens are a problem primarily because they can complicate diagnosis or treatment of other issues.  For example, an accessory spleen can appear to be something else, or perhaps obscure something else, on a CT scan.  Or maybe if someone has a malady that requires a splenectomy, it's possible to only remove the main spleen and not realize that more needs to be done, meaning that the malady still exists.

595,gpb8dw,Don't antibody tests need to detect multiple configurations of antibodies?,,"I'm under the impression that multiple antibodies with different binding site structures can be made by different people for the same pathogen. Every piece of literature I read refer to ""the antibody"" for a certain pathogen like it's some kind of singular monolithic thing, where in reality I think antibodies for a certain pathogen are actually pluralistic things with a certain degree of variability? There is no ""antibody."" There is no ""the antibody"" for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 for instance can have multiple unique areas on their protein structures in which multiple different antibodies can be generated, so one recovered patient can have slightly different antibodies compared to another recovered patient, but both of their antibodies will still bind to different unique areas of SARS-CoV-2.

There are even companies that have whittled down numerous different antibody candidates to a few that have especially high neutralizing abilities against SARS-COV-2, the point being that multiple different antibodies can bind to one pathogen.

So when people talk about an ""antibody test,"" what are they talking about, exactly? 

Does the test actually detect the presence of *multiple* different antibodies, all of which have demonstrated binding effects with the virus? 

Or do the tests only detect one specific configuration of antibody, and can miss other antibody configurations, resulting in a false negative (the patient actually had been infected and did produce antibodies, just not the ones that the test is specific for).",,8,askscience

I generally respond that this will involve many times the number of deaths that have occurred already.  My rationale is quite simple: Covid-19 has a current 1.4% mortality rate (due mostly to old people and people with poor immune function), and 'herd immunity' involves at least 60% population immunity (likely higher to be more effective). That means that if we just let the disease continue to spread as it has, the final USA death count will be 330million x 60% x 1.4% = 2.8 million.  Even if we somehow could control who gets the virus to restrict it to the healthiest people, this would mean something like a 0.4% total mortality (lowest group-mortality by age seems to be around 0.2-0.3%, and let's assume it spreads a bit outside of that).

The blacksmith trick of using a magnet to tell if steel is austenitic is just a guess, because carbon steel actually reaches its Curie temperature a bit before the austentic transformation temperature. 

I didn't realize until recently that room temperature austenitic steel (stainless steel) is also not ferromagnetic. My first thought was that this was somehow due to crystal structure (some symmetry operation in FCC that forbids ferromagnetism?) but that doesn't work because there are other examples of FCC metals that exhibit ferromagnetism, like Ni or Co alloys.

My next thought was that Weiss domains in FCC might get thermally misaligned more easily, so perhaps the Curie temperature would be decreased in FCC metals, and Ni could stay ferromagnetic because it had a Curie temperature above 300K. However, Ni has a smaller magnetic moment per atom and a lower melting temperature (than iron or stainless steel), so assuming Curie temperatures occur at roughly the same homologous temperature, Ni should have a lower Curie temperature (it does have a lower Curie temperature than BCC iron).

That leaves me with no explanation for why steel loses its ferromagnetism upon becoming FCC. Does anyone have any ideas?",,7,askscience

667,gnzjxx,Aerodynamics: why should max lift-to-drag airspeed be the same as min-drag airspeed?,,"I need help from someone who knows aerodynamics well, in connection with aerodynamics study material that all student pilots are asked to learn, specifically how the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio varies as a function of airspeed.

The basic idea is to give the pilot an intuition of the fact that lift grows quadratically with airspeed, and so (somewhat) does drag, but there's a component of drag (induced) that grows a lot if you fly slow. For this reason, total drag exhibits a U-shaped plot, and the airspeed corresponding to the butt of the U is a sweet spot that gives you best range. That's the airspeed you should fly at for best economy, and the airspeed to establish in case of engine loss, to achieve best glide distance. If you fly faster, you glide less, and if you also fly slower, you also glide less.

More specifically, Most ground schools, including official FAA sanctioned material, present the same or very similar airspeed-drag charts, all having airspeed in knots on the x axis, and arbitrary drag units on y. They all plot parasite, induced, form (sometimes) and total drag curves. (Total drag D is the sum of parasite, induced and form drag.) Here is an example: [https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course\_content\_popup.aspx?cID=104&sID=448](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course_content_popup.aspx?cID=104&sID=448)

They consistently make the claim that **the airspeed maximizing L/D is also the one that minimizes total drag**.

Note: they don't say that the two airspeeds (the one maximizing L/D and the one minimizing D) are **close enough** that we can confound them. No, they say they are the same.

I'm a weekend pilot with a background in engineering and a day job in a quantitative field, and this claim bothers me. I played around for five minutes with a graphic calculator and plugged in simple functions that look close enough to those in the abstract plots:

* DI = Induced drag = 1/(500v)
* DF = Form Drag = 5 + 1/100 (v-45)\^2
* DP = Parasite Drag = 1/200 v\^2
* L = Lift = 1/5 v\^2   \*\*\*
* D = Total Drag = DI+DF+DP

Of course, empirical experiments confirm my intuition that there's no chance in hell that argmax(L(v)/D(v)) matches argmin(D(v)).

Am I right? Am I wrong?

Of course the FAA's goal is not to teach physics, it's rather to give pilot simplified, actionable intuition that is mostly physically correct and that inspires the right in-flight decision.

But I'd like to hear from an expert how things really are.

**UPDATE:**

**SOLVED! ------------** Thanks to the kind redditors who answered.

I was incorrectly assuming that in these charts, lift was made to vary as a function of airspeed.

This is a result of my brain being primed to equation L = 1/2 CL œÅ S v^(2), the lift equation, that one typically studies in the same chapter.

If you assume constant CL and constant air density œÅ, of course lift grows quadratically with airspeed.

However, these charts assume steady, unaccelerated, level flight, in which lift is constant, and made to exactly balance weight. As airspeed grows, smaller and smaller AoA are needed to balance W, and correspondingly smaller and smaller CL values.

Then, L becomes a constant, and   argmax(L(v)/D(v)) = argmax(c/D(v)) = argmin(D(v)).

Thank you!

Chan School of Public Health and Director of Harvard‚Äôs Healthy Buildings Program. Ask me anything about COVID-19 and the future of the built environment, AMA!",,"I am an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the founding director of the [Healthy Buildings Program](https://forhealth.org/). I also have a new book, out last month: *[Healthy Buildings](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237971)*. In March 2020, I became co-chair of the International Well Building Institute‚Äôs Coronavirus Task Force.

For several years in private industry before joining the faculty at Harvard, I led teams of scientists and engineers investigating, and resolving, hundreds of indoor environmental quality issues, from'sick buildings' to cancer clusters to all types of chemical/radiological/biological hazards. I learned two important facts: 1) too often we are responding to issues after there is a problem, and 2) we cannot solve these problems without a multidisciplinary approach. I have an interest in the dynamic interplay between the indoor environment and health and am continuing this line of research at Harvard, with a focus on optimizing indoor environments for health benefits. A natural extension of my research on buildings and the indoor environment is the consideration of the products we use in those environments, and how those influence our exposure and health.

I believe that we have to force a collision between these two disciplines: building science and health science. The indoor built environment (homes, offices, schools, hospitals, airplanes, laboratories) plays a critical role in our overall health, both due to the amount of time we spend indoors (~90%) and the ability of the buildings to positively and negatively influence our exposure. The goal is to improve the health of all people, in all buildings, everywhere, every day.

The pandemic spawned by the novel coronavirus has given us a heightened awareness of the role our buildings play in our health and wellbeing. I'm on the record back in [early February](https://www.ft.com/content/5083fd42-4812-11ea-aee2-9ddbdc86190d) advocating for healthy buildings strategies, like air filtration and increased ventilation, to reduce the spread of the virus indoors. Since then, I've written several articles about what we can do to reduce our exposure to the virus, including in [grocery stores](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/26/dont-panic-about-shopping-getting-delivery-or-accepting-packages/), [public parks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/13/keep-parks-open-benefits-fresh-air-outweigh-risks-infection/), and [cars/ride shares](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/22/coronavirus-car-protect-yourself-column/5166146002/).

698,gn2aii,Why do myocytes reach +30mV in phase 0 of the action potential (AP) in both normal physiologic environments AND hyperkalemic environment? Shouldn't the hyperkalemic environment AP be lower?,,"Hi everyone, I have a question that came up while researching inactivation gates on Na+ channels.

&#x200B;

From reading Goldin (2003) ""Mechanisms of sodium channel inactivation,"" it seems that some Na+ channels have a time-dependent inactivation channel that closes during the depolarization phase of an action potential.  My question specifically pertains to the mechanics of these inactivation gates during a state of extracellular hyperkalemia. In this paper: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1413606/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1413606/), on figure 3 we see an overlaid cardiac action potential of a normal potential and one that occurs in hyperkalemia. I understand from the GHK equation that hyperkalemia would cause an elevation in cell resting membrane potential, but what I am having trouble understanding is why the peak reached by both actions potentials are the same, to \~+30mV. The authors state that ""The membrane potential at the onset of depolarization determines the  number of sodium channels activated during depolarization, which in turn determines the magnitude of the inward sodium current and the Vmax of the action potential. "" Linking this with my understanding of the inactivation gates, I understand this statement to mean that in a higher than normal cell resting potential environment, less Na channels are able to participate in an action potential due to failure to ""reset"" the inactivation gate, which is directly dependent on cell repolarization. If there are less Na channels participating in phase 0 of the action potential and if inactivation gates are time-dependent, why then, do both phase 0s reach +30mV? Shouldn't the hyperkalemia AP be lower than +30mV because less total Na+ influx would have been achieved before inactivation gates closed due to less Na channel participation?",,8,askscience

My confusion is around:

1) Serology data only point to maybe 10% of the population tested positive for COVID-19. (Source 2) This should mean we have a long way to go before herd immunity, right? 

2) Is there any possibility the virus is ""fizzling out"" via mutation?

4) In 1918, we saw cases decline significantly between the first and second wave. Do we know the exact reasons why that occurred?

I'm asking because I remember reading, one time, that in a survival situation, it's not worth it to eat unless you can guarantee at least 1500 calories of food. I vaguely recall that the poster said something about how your digestive system would be mostly shut down after a few days of no food and that the energy cost of spinning things up, the loss from decreased efficiency when still recovering from starvation mode, and then the cost of keeping the system running until it shut down again wouldn't be net positive unless you got at least \~1500 calories. Many (most?) humans survive on a diet of fewer than 1500 calories daily, so I'm only asking about a short-term break in starvation of a large human (let's say 100kg male.)

Sub-questions that I think could answer the main question if pieced together properly:

* What is the reduction in efficiency of the digestive system following a period of starvation, if any?
* How long does the body take to recognize and react to starvation in terms of reducing the energy spent on maintaining the GIT?
* What is the cost to ""spin up"" the GIT after it's ""shut down"" in reaction to starvation, if any?

One is that those projectiles aren't shot with such velocity that they simply break free from the Sun's gravitational pull, or go into orbit around it. And the other is that the gun's muzzle velocity could be adjusted for the Earth's position with each shot.

The reason I ask is that I'd like to the know about the feasibility of ridding the planet of fissile materials from dismantled nuclear weapons and power plants by blasting small packages of it, day and night, for years, into the Sun by way of a very large electromagnetic gun, which could be powered by stored electricity from solar panels or windmills. (Many years ago I read about a proposal to get rid of decommissioned nuclear weapons by firing them into the Sun, but that was by way of rockets.) It seems to me that using an electromagnetic gun would cause far less atmospheric damage than than endless launches of big rockets would. Probably a lot less expensive, too.

744,glg9x9,Why are scientists unsure about whether COVID-19 Antibodies cause long-term immunity?,,"Short question: I keep hearing the same point repeated over and over again. ""Scientists don't know if antibodies protect you from reinfection."" What exactly do scientists not know? Are they unsure of the B-Cell memory timeline? Do they doubt the antibodies ability to neutralize the virus? Or are they saying this out of an abundance of caution? 

&#x200B;

Longer question: I was a Molecular Biology Major in undergrad. I know some of the big concepts of immunology, but I don't know enough to talk with any authority. Based on what I know, I am going to lay out my theory about why scientists avoid answering this question. Can you please tell me where my theory is incorrect?

&#x200B;

Essentially, my understanding is that IgM antibodies will give people long-term immunity. COVID does not mutate quickly because it has a RNA proofreading system (Source posted below). Therefore, We shouldn't worry about next year's COVID having different serotypes that our body won't recognize.

The other questions is about B-Cell memory. How long will your body continue to produce antibodies? I know that B-cells for Lyme disease have a particularly short memory (less than 6 months). However, everything I've read online indicates that similar Corona viruses leave relatively long B-Cell memories. This article ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851497/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851497/)) says that people infected with SARS had around 3 years of elevated IgG. But of course, after 3 years they should still have IgM antibodies, right? If reinfected, shouldn't they be able to replenish their IgG antibodies much faster than the original infection? In addition, even if COVID Antibodies last 3 years, that would give us plenty of time to develop a vaccine and provide people with booster shots. Am I missing something about B-Cell memory?

I've also read articles that describe healthy people who get infected with COVID and die of a cytokine attacks ([https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/how-does-coronavirus-kill-clinicians-trace-ferocious-rampage-through-body-brain-toes](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/how-does-coronavirus-kill-clinicians-trace-ferocious-rampage-through-body-brain-toes)). In essence, a cytokine attack is when your immune system is kicked into overdrive. It starts killing off cells indiscriminately, including your own cells. This is what killed so many people during Spanish flu. Young people were at higher risk because they had a stronger immune system. Now, I don't know enough about cytokine storms to answer this question properly, but are scientists worried that the presence of antibodies could cause these attacks? If not, it seems that antibodies should keep one safe from the most serious effects of COVID.

&#x200B;

My (non-expert) opinion is that scientists won't say that some people are immune out of an abundance of caution. I also think its political. If people know that getting infected leads to immunity, young people will purposely catch the virus. In addition, people with antibodies would be able to leave lockdown, creating more civil unrest. A nytimes opinion article ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/opinion/coronavirus-antibody-certificate-testing.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/opinion/coronavirus-antibody-certificate-testing.html)) talked about this issue. If people who are immune can return to work, the remaining people without antibodies will be at an economic disadvantage. Would employers ask for your COVID status? Could you lose a job based on whether you can safely return to work? By being ambiguous about whether antibodies keep someone safe, we are not forced to confront these more difficult political questions.

I live in an area with hard water so get a lot of limescale in the kettle (by which I mean a stand-alone electric kettle, I‚Äôm in the UK).

Presumably limescale buildup could be prevented if I were to rinse out and then thoroughly dry the inside of the kettle with a towel after each use.

However, as I understand, angular momentum is a vector and thus has a direction. If the object is initially spinning around a given axis, its angular momentum points in the direction of this axis (I think). How is it possible then that conservation of angular momentum holds if the axis of rotation has changed? There seems to be some flaw with my reasoning and I'd like to figure out what it is.",,5,askscience

I have seen acceleration defined as the second derivative of position w.r.t. time. Knowing this, acceleration is not necessarily continuous, but it at least takes all intermediate values on an interval.

However, I am not sure I like this definition and its consequences.

I have heard of the ""jerk,"" the third derivative of position w.r.t. time. If this derivative exists, then acceleration is differentiable, therefore continuous. However, I have no intuitive reason to believe ""jerk"" always exists.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I think we also have the following:

In an inertial frame of reference, for a body of constant mass m, we have (1/m)F = a. This feels like a more fundamental characterization of acceleration, but perhaps I am just pushing my curiosity onto forces.

If force is necessarily a continuous function of time, then acceleration is continuous as a consequence. The converse holds, too.

Are acceleration and force continuous functions of time? If so, how do we know? Do these results hold at all size scales at any speed?

Bonus points: Are there any good books about classical mechanics for someone of my background? I find myself in a strange place:
beginning undergraduate books are very frustrating because they obscure the truth behind physical notions and focus on menial calculations in extremely limited scenarios (""incline plane problems"", ""pendulum problems"", etc.). Higher level books, on the other hand, assume complete knowledge of simpler concepts.

So controlling other variables (weather, greenhouse gases, etc.) what impact do these types of materials have on warming the planet? In the extreme, would a planet completely covered in solar panels be a different temperature than one that does not?

I have an ME in geology and geophysics from the University of Paris, and a PhD in astronomy and space sciences from Cornell University. I was privileged to be Joe Veverka's last graduate student, and Carl Sagan's last T.A..

My research focuses on the history of water on Mars, ice and caves on the Moon and Mars, the origin of Mars' moons, and the future human exploration of the Moon and Mars. I do fieldwork at Moon and Mars analog sites, mostly on Devon Island in the Arctic where we go every summer for the HMP (https://www.marsinstitute.no/hmp), but also in Antarctica where I once wintered over for 402-days. I'm still thawing from that.

I also work on surface exploration systems for future Moon and Mars exploration: drones, hoppers, rovers, spacesuits, and habitats. I was lucky to serve as scientist-pilot for NASA's first field test of the LER (Lunar Exploration Rover) SPR (small pressurized rover) concept. I also led the Northwest Passage Drive Expedition, a record-setting vehicular traverse on sea-ice along the fabled Northwest Passage - now that was a bad idea - and the subject of the documentary film Passage To Mars (2016). I currently lead the HMP's Astronaut Smart Glove project and JPL's GlobeTrotter planetary hopper concept study.

I am also interested in SETI - the actual Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. I've argued that there are likely very few advanced civilizations per galaxy, and we might be the only one in ours at this time. As you might imagine, it's not the most popular view at the SETI Institute.

In my free time, I enjoy being walked by my 1-year old Australian cattle dog, Apollo. I also love to fly and paint, although not at the same time. I am an FAA-certified helicopter commercial pilot and flight instructor, and an artist member of the IAAA (International Association of Astronomical Artists). I post some of my drawings and paintings on Instagram @spacetimeartist.

Is this a common occurrence? As a specific example, could I take a DNA Polymerase protein, unfold it completely, and then fold it up in a different shape and arrive at a molecular machine that serves a completely different function or will it just be a useless, jumbled mess?

[Vox] (https://www.vox.com/2020/4/13/21215133/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-screening) recently wrote an article about how the US needs millions of tests available per day. If the end goal of the quarantine is to bring the R-naught value below one until a vaccine has been approved, and the amount of testing available is limited, why don't states use random sample tests to derive the overall rate of infections in the population, and use those estimates to determine the overall R-naught value? I'm nature sure about the accuracy of the currently available test, but even if they were only 95% accurate, we could get a pretty good model with only 16,000 or so tests a day in the United States?

962,ghyq6j,What factors affect the shape and terrain of continents?,,"With COVID-19 I've had plenty of time on my hands and got to wondering about how continents come to be as well as the terrain on them. Obviously in the distant past all the continents were originally one Pangaea and have since drifted apart, and various landmasses themselves are still being formed by volcano eruptions and suchlike.

But what other factors are significant in shaping terrain, how much of an impact do they have, and how regularly do they have such an impact? Things I considered were sea level, volcanoes, extreme weather, tsunamis, earthquakes, and man-made interventions (e.g. nuclear weapons).

What predictions are there concerning how our planet will look in 50 years, 100, 1000, 5000 and 20000 years? Is that a significant timescale for planetary reshaping? And how big an impact can humans have on what terrain looks like, the shape of the continents, and subsequent impacts on ecosystems and weather patterns?

Apologies if this is a little too broad, but the topic feels really big. In summary, I suppose my questions are 1) What affects the shape/terrain of continents, 2) How big an impact do humans have on those factors and on their timescale, and 3) Are there any predictions or reasonable assumptions we can make about how the planet will look differently 50/100/1000/5000/20000 years from now, based on both natural and human activity?",,4,askscience

Another example would be how RNA polymerase can create a favorable surface for bases to allow extension as fast as 40-80 nt per second?¬†

Are the densities (of bases, parts of polymerase...) just kept very high and due to rapid enough random motion it ends up working?

975,gvc7k9,Black Lives Matter,,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs‚Äô effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media‚Äôs excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people‚Äôs hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

There are lots of ways you could raise your temperature a little (or a lot if you‚Äôre not careful), such as showers, baths, hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas, etc... 

My understanding is that a fever helps fight infection by acting in two ways. The higher temperature inhibits the bug‚Äôs ability to reproduce in the body, and it also makes some cells in our immune system more effective at fighting the infection. 

So, would basically giving yourself a fever, or increasing it if it were a very low grade fever, help?",,14001,askscience

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-Íú•n·∏´-ƒ±Õómn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taÀàwaÀêt Àà ïaÀênxu  îaÀàmaÀên]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

Why this happens?

Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

Thank you to everyone who answered this! I've seen some of your answers, and maybe I wasn't very clear. Yes, I can remember and imagine pictures, places and random things. It's just that for music, it's WAY easier to ""replay"" it on my mind. With pictures, it's a little bit more difficult. I do not have aphantasia.

Some of you have pointed out that this varies from person to person.  It made sense to me that it was a common behavior, but after reading your comments and thinking about it for some time, I saw that my initial thought was erroneous. Thanks for pointing that out.

Also, some of you pointed out that it's easier to ""replay"" music in our head for evolutionary reasons.  As our eyes are always occupied with seeing things, if we could just imagine a vivid lion in front of us, it would be a disaster.  That is something that I've never thought about, and makes a lot of sense.

And, some of you also said that it's related to repetition. If I'm listening to a song over and over, my brain will remember it perfectly after some repetitions. 

So, after reading your answers, I've come to the understanding that this happens because of a series of factors that when combined, will favor my hearing memory instead of my visual memory. And that this is not true for everyone - some may have a better visual memory, and some may not even be able to imagine things at all.

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

1323,69r3rt,"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400¬∞F, how is the earths core magnetic?",,"After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

1358,9odirf,Prosthetics: Can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?,,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

Any thoughts?

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

&#x200B;

Nowadays people are less physically active, and the rate of depression has been rising. Physical exercise is regularly advised as a remedy for depression and other mental health issues. Could it therefore be, that normal mental health requires a ""homeostatic"" amount of physical activity? Does sedentary lifestyle play a part in the grand scheme of more people becoming depressed?

1434,7l1x9j,Has there ever been evidence of spatial dimensions beyond the three we can perceive?,,"Lately I've become extremely interested in spatial dimensions beyond length, width, and height, reading Flatland, etc.

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? Or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and I'm just unaware?",,8202,askscience

1444,bzar5g,Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth‚Äôs 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite ‚Äì Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

TIL: the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a [WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87).

**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

- No one that I could notice here has put forward any data on international reported flu/cold rates to draw a rough comparrison between Japan and the world.

We've designed a free online course, '[Climate Change: Challenges and Solutions](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions)' to show you some of the science behind Climate Change, present the challenges and identify potential solutions to these global problems. Today we want to open this up to r/askscience, so please ask us anything about Climate Change!

Professor Tim Lenton is actively researching tipping points in the Earth system, especially the Climate system, and identifying early warning signs for them. He is also studying the revolutionary transformations of the Earth System, including the co-evolution of life and the planet. Dr Damien Mansell's principal research interests include the calving processes of tidewater-terminating glaciers, glacier surges, cryosphere instabilities and remote sensing for glaciological applications. His teaching specialises in GIS and remote sensing techniques and understanding the cryosphere.

1547,3o82rc,Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?,,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

My team at UCSF hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. AMA!",,"I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


I'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!

I've had this question bouncing in my brain for literal years but recently I got a cat and now I can't forget it. 

How do cats inherently know how to use a litter box? I saw videos on kittens and how they figure out how to use them in like 8 weeks. So they genuinely know how to use it almost from the beginning. 

I can't think of a litter box like thing in the ""wild"" so I'm really curious. Also how do they recognize that as their new bathroom? Like they had to have some alternative to what they normally would use, so how do they know that is where they're supposed to go?

I recently learnt about superconductors and how they can essentially keep current running in a loop forever without losing energy. Random idea just popped into my mind - since we've developed fibre optics - a way of transmitting data by sending light patterns with energy loss close to 0 - why can't we use principles such as TIR (total internal reflection) to collect large amounts of light (sunlight) and then store it similar to how the superconductor bank works? 

If we could be able to store light as a form of energy - could be collected, amplified by using mirrors and be a source of sustainable energy much alike solar panels (quite inefficient). 

So to all the scientists out there, is this concept plausible? and if it is, what could we do with such a concept?

Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

1687,g97dpz,Does gravity have a range or speed?,,"So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- Perfectly spherical
- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping.

Imagine you are walking to the bus stop. Your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal.

If you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it?

I'm Kaeli Swift a behavioral ecologist specializing in crows and other corvids at the University of Washington.  Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the *cutest* corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.  Along the way, I found some pretty surprising things out about how and when crows touch dead crows.  Let's just say sometimes they really put the crow in necrophilia! 

You can find coverage of my funeral work at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/science/crows-necrophilia.html), on the [Ologies](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ologies/e/56956025) podcast, and PBS's [Deep Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixYVFZnNl6s).

It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. So, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

I am also the co-founder of the [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/), an organization that creates novel, multimedia experience to bring science to general audiences.

My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. 

I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, *The Elegant Universe*, *The Fabric of the Cosmos*, *The Hidden Reality*, and just recently, *Until the End of Time*. *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)* and *[The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)* were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, *Icarus at the End of Time*, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage *[Light Falls](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)*, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.

These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.

I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.

I'll be here at 11 a.m. ET (15 UT), AMA!

**Our experts are here to answer your questions, and this year we have a treat that's *almost* sweeter than pi: we've teamed up with some experts from /r/AskHistorians to bring you the history of pi.** We'd like to extend a special thank you to these users for their contributions here today!

Here's some reading from /u/Jooseman to get us started:

> The symbol œÄ was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when Welsh Mathematician William Jones (a man who was also close friends with Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley) used it in his work *Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos* (or a *New Introduction to the Mathematics*.) There are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. The favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient Greek word for periphery (the circumference).

> Before this time the symbol œÄ has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.

> The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *Mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *Introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.

It is an open question whether dynamics similar to those seen in the oil droplet experiments underly the statistical theory of quantum mechanics.

Not unlike an atom, in which case the nucleus would be here,"" pointing to the top-right corner of the holographic projection of a spherical atom. Although I'm a huge fan of the MCU, I know they're mostly scientifically inaccurate, but still sparked some curiosity within me. I am aware of the unpredictable nature of electrons, which is why I asked if it applied to the nucleus too. Assuming an atom is a so-so approximate sphere, would the nucleus exist exactly at the centre of the sphere or is it in the corner? You can calculate the probability of an electron's position by squaring it's wavefunction and integrating wrt to position. I was curious about the probability density of the nucleus's location, and is it highest at the centre or at another location? Does the unpredictable nature of electrons apply to the nucleus too? If so, can one determine the probability density of the location of a nucleus via the Schr√∂dinger Equation? If so, is there a graph representing this probability density of the location of a nucleus? Hope I've made my question clearer :)

AMA.",,"I‚Äôm **Ed Damiano**, and for nearly 20 years I‚Äôve been developing bionic pancreas technology to automate blood-sugar control.

When my infant son, David, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, my wife and I learned quickly how hard it was to get insulin dosing right in managing his blood-sugar levels, especially in such a small child. I began to imagine a wearable bionic pancreas that would automatically manage his blood-sugar levels without our intervention or his, when he grew up and became responsible for his own care.

Inspired by David‚Äôs diagnosis, I began developing, testing, and refining bionic pancreas technology. My students, postdocs, and I began conducting experiments at Boston University testing an early version of the device running on a laptop computer in 2005. Together with our clinical collaborators at the Massachusetts General Hospital, we progressed to in-patient trials in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in 2008. Between 2013 and 2018, my team at BU and our clinical collaborators conducted over a dozen outpatient and home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes, testing various mobile versions of our bionic pancreas technology, which was developed and refined in my lab at BU.

In 2015, I co-founded Beta Bionics¬Æ, Inc., a Massachusetts Public Benefit Corporation that is committed to the singular mission of commercializing a bionic pancreas for people with diabetes and other disorders of blood sugar regulation. Beta Bionics licensed the bionic pancreas technology from BU in 2015. Since then, Beta Bionics has developed a purpose-built, fully integrated, wearable, closed-loop device - referred to as the iLet¬Æ bionic pancreas - that is designed to automate blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes. Over the past two years, the iLet¬Æ bionic pancreas has been tested in several home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. 440 adults and children with type 1 diabetes are currently being screened for enrollment into a phase 3 clinical trial testing the iLet bionic pancreas at 16 clinical sites across the US. The clinical data from this study will support a market application for the iLet bionic pancreas to the US FDA.

1890,guh3lt,Is the Immune Response to Poison Ivy or Mosquitos Nessecary or is it a Defect?,,"I recently moved to the Great Lakes, and there are a LOT of things in this environment that my immune system does not like. I have had adverse reactions to poison ivy, chiggars, stinging nettle, and mosquitos that have covered my skin in welts.

I understand that this is the result of my immune system reacting to a foreign chemical introduced into the body. But what I don't understand is why? The oil from poison ivy isn't a virus or an infections agent. So why does the immune system attack it?

Are these the results of a defect in our immune system, or does the body attack these substances and the cells they encounter to prevent a larger problem?

My lab is building more efficient CRISPR-based gene editing tools to supercharge the human immune system to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity. AMA!",,"Genetic engineering is now cheap, relatively simple, and pretty reliable - at least when done in a lab setting. Using a tool called CRISPR, researchers can access DNA in live cells, target specific strings of the DNA code to slice out, turn gene expression up or down, or even swap in new DNA. This means we can, theoretically, reverse genetic conditions, modify cell behaviors, and perhaps program the cells to better fight against disease.

If you want an overview on CRISPR and how it works, my university created this animated explainer: [https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXgU--ugLqY)

My lab is using CRISPR to better understand how the genome controls the functions of human immune cells, in health and disease. We hope to use this research to inform future cell-based therapies to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.

If you're deeply interested in CRISPR, you may have heard of our recent work - we discovered a way to make CRISPR more efficient and flexible in re-writing long DNA sequences in human immune cells, without the use of viruses. There are currently FDA approved gene engineered T cell therapies for certain types of cancer. These cells have been generated by using modified viruses to deliver genes into haphazard sites in the T cell genomes. Improved non-viral CRISPR delivery allows us, effectively, to paste long new stretches of DNA sequences into specific sites in the genome, without having to rely viruses that are costly and laborious to employ. We are working to develop non-viral CRISPR-based genome targeting into broadly useful platforms to make better, faster, cheaper engineered T cells for the next generation of immunotherapies.

You can read my university's story about it here: [http://tiny.ucsf.edu/OccPKL](http://tiny.ucsf.edu/OccPKL)

Andy: ""Well, it was radioactive and found in the ground before. Why not put it back when we are done with it?""

Moonlapsed: ""Probably because it's a lot more concentrated after its refined""

Andy: ""So just dilute it and spread it out like before""

Moonlapsed: ""...""

I am not sure wether this is the correct place to ask this question but here goes.
Does the force of gravity travel at the speed of light? 

I have read some articles that we haven't confirmed this experimentally.
If I understand this correctly newtonian gravity claims instant force..
So that's a no-go.
Now I wonder how accurate relativistic calculations are and how much room they allow for deviations.( 99%c for example)
Are we experiencing the gravity of the sun 499 seconds ago?

Sorry , i did not mean the force of gravity but the gravitational waves .

I work as a DS for a fortune 100 company. It‚Äôs my first data science role and I‚Äôve been here a little short of a year. We have no way of implementing models and I‚Äôve built a few production worthy scoring engines. The company is trying to get up to speed with analytics and data science but is still behind in the curve in terms of technology and utilizing data and their data scientists.

This leads to my question. Is anyone else in a role where you are ‚Äúlooking for drivers‚Äù or ‚Äúkey factors‚Äù regularly. It seems as though this is a huge majority of the work and all people care about. ‚ÄúLooking for segments‚Äù or ‚Äútell stories‚Äù. It seems extremely trivial and the amount of work reducing extremely wide datasets to a selection of variables that can tell a story is a relatively big task. They‚Äôre so open ended and can tend to be misleading. This feels like more of a business analytics role (even though so many titles seem arbitrary). They‚Äôre looking to have a production ready environment by the end of this year but it seems that actually having the business utilize scoring engines is unlikely.

5429,hc83zi,How to combine data science with data engineering?,,"Hey everyone.

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics"").

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well.

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira.

Now, I really have a tough decision to make. Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science? What would be the best path to take?

5430,hby6qg,What PC components are a priority for speeding up predictive modelling?,,"Hi all, i'm a data scientist working primarily with R & R Markdown and am looking at building a PC for gaming and data science work and I began to realize I know a fair amount about optimizing for gaming performance but almost nothing about what speeds up predictive modeling and other stages of a data scientists workflow.

* Is base CPU speed important? Number of cores? Threads? Cache?
* I know with R, enough RAM to fit datasets into memory and work with them isimportant, but does additional RAM beyond that help? What about RAM speed? (e.g. would 2400MHz -> 3200MHz make any difference?)
* Does the motherboard matter at all, aside from having enough space for future RAM upgrades if needed?
* Does the GPU matter if you're not doing deep learning?

5444,ha71r6,Identifying Patterns in Time Series Data With Multiple Variables,,"I must warn before I begin that I am coming from the hard science sphere (and am trying to integrate some novel data science) so some of the things I talk about might make no sense. Please ask questions!

I have a database of \~20 variables that are collected continuously over time. This database is essentially measuring the conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field (too complex to model) which drives numerous phenomena that occur in the Earth's atmosphere, etc. These phenomena are of interest to researchers but only occur ever so often. To find these, you have to manually search years and years of data, something that is simply not too practical.

I want to develop some sort of method to take a number of instances of a phenomenon and search the continuous database for more instances. I think that this needs to be split into two tasks.

1. Discover common patterns (dips, spikes, sign changes, or even more complex ""shapes"") between the inputted instances. It will also have to discern the variables of interest because not all in the database will drive a single phenomenon. Moreover, if the program can then output these relationships (such as variables appear to drive the phenomenon) this will be of interest to users.
2. Use these relationships to search the continuous stream for more instances.

5447,ha85yi,Monte Carlo (or other methods) for Ingredient Concentration Estimation,,"Weird title but hear me out.

**THE PROBLEM**

I have a sample product that is comprised of let's say 3 ingredients, each with concentrations listed in ranges of the total product composition:

&#x200B;

|Ingredient|min concentration (%)|max concentration (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|x|25|50|
|y|25|50|
|z|25|50|

Now based on the concentration of each ingredient, the overall product is going to have a different toxicity profile.

If x = 50% y = 25% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of say 100.

But if x = 25%, y = 50% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of perhaps 75.

This is a real world problem (ingredients are often listed in ranges), so I guess I can assume normality of the distribution of each ingredient range (or uniformity?).

**WHAT I WANT**

I want to show a probability distribution of overall toxicity, based on some simulated concentration values. Maybe making 1000 potential ingredient ""configurations"" and then running the resulting calculations.

Python & R related solutions are ideal.",,2,datascience
5448,h9q7im,Things I Learned while building Machine Learning web app,,"These past weeks I've been working on an ML web app as a side project. Being a Data Scientist, I decided to take on this project for two reasons. First, it would make for a good learning experience for the things I'm not very comfortable with like Design/Front-end and Deployment tasks. Second, as I found most of the materials lacking, I thought I could gather some useful information to write a blog post about it.

I made a web app that tracks the sentiment on twitter towards the leaders of the top political parties in Spain. It works ‚Äîmore or less‚Äî in real-time. The site is live here: [https://polituits.com/](https://polituits.com/)

Some things went well, others that I could have done better, and others that at this point I'm not sure haha (e.g., How much traffic would it handle?). I thought I could share those things before getting to work on the blog post.

I'll start with the **things that made my life easier:**

1. [End-to-end Machine Learning App](https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/case-studies/end-to-end-ml-app). This is a great resource. It goes through the full process of building a Machine Learning application in a realistic setting. Most of the materials you'll find out there will skip deployment or work with simple data sets. This one goes from scraping to deploying in AWS. A few days ago, I also read [this one](http://veekaybee.github.io/2020/06/09/ml-in-prod/), which I also recommend.
2. [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). I compared Streamlit and Dash and went with the latter for better documentation and a more significant community. The deployment part was especially painful, so proper documentation was critical to get the job done.
3. [HugginFace's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/). If you are working with NLP tasks in languages other than English, check HuggingFace's repository of community models. Furthermore, it is relatively easy to integrate into an inference service built with Pytorch/Flask.
4. [Abhishek Thakur's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPRJjIWfyNG4X-CRbnv78A) and [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/notebooks) for fine-tuning BERT. Fantastic resources that saved me a lot of time. Especially when using those ideas with a pre-trained BERT in Spanish from HuggingFace's transformers.
5. More generally, I benefited from keeping the toolset simple. I used PowerPoint when I started designing the app (see the initial design [here](https://twitter.com/_dylancastillo/status/1272238506916675591)), SQLite as a database, and Python/Dash (instead of JavaScript).

Now, the **things that I wish I had done differently:**

1. Contain the scope. I started with a straightforward idea and then started adding stuff that just made my life harder. Most of the time, I think it was because I felt the app was not ""complex"" enough for publishing it.
2. Deployment. Ha! The only good thing about it's that it ""works"". Right now, it is a painfully manual process. I should have gotten to a better deployment process from the beginning. By the time I started deploying, it felt like too much work.
3. Sacrificed code quality. I wanted to ship this quickly. So the code is not DRY. It's more like CRY yourself to sleep. Refactoring is among my top priorities now.
4. Model. It's not great right now. It only gets the job done. I did not dedicate that much time to labeling data for fine-tuning the model. This is also a priority for me right now.

Finally, there are many things for which I don't know if I was following the ""best practices."" In particular, setting up NGINX and Gunicorn felt a bit *hacky*. Sooner or later, I guess I'll find out.

EDIT: Just noticed the big typo on the title. Sorry! haha",,40,datascience

So is knowing all the math and statistical theory behind models becoming less important as more and more data science jobs become more engineering-focused roles? I understand that it obviously doesn't hurt to have a strong math background, and my question is NOT whether the math/stats stopped becoming important.

I have developed a serious interest in NLP, but I secretly wish I could use NLP for my personal projects (of which I have plenty of ideas), rather than my job. Some of my frustrations of the latter include:

- Having to read so many badly-written papers and repos. Furthermore, I find the leaderboard chasing and the Frankenstein deep learning models quite off-putting (do we really need transformer + CNN + multi-task learning + multi-lingual model + dual-encoder evaluated on 10 different datasets without any deeper analysis within a single paper?).
- Many of the deep learning models might work well in some leaderboard, but incorporating them to our data is rife with logistical and performance issues. Worse is that most of them are just black-box models with little means to debug if they return a wrong result.
- I'm not really interested in the product that we're building so much that I'm willing to go all in with regard to the above two points. I keep day-dreaming about the NLP projects that *I* want to build and the interesting NLP papers that *I* want to read. Worse is that I'm often so burned out at work that I find little motivation to do any further work on NLP after work.

Perhaps my grievances are with the R&D nature of my job, rather than data science itself.

In logic, high value customers should get better service, but in practice we don't differentiate customers because they all receive the best service we could (or try to) offer.

5480,h0iefy,How or What do you model for in an inherently unpredictable field?,,"Hello my fellow data science professionals, I hope you all are keeping safe and doing well.

So a bit of background to the question, one of my close friend runs a business which operates in the event & entertainment industry.
He is a vendor that provides a niche service for large format events & activations. let's call this service A for the sake of this post.

Service A requires a lot of equipment and people who are skilled in operating that equipment. He has his own large inventory of equipment but once in a while, he gets an event with a large scope, wherein to be able to provide that service, he has to purchase more inventory, which might be used immediately or can remain with him for a long time.
He has employees hired to manage and deliver the service, but again if the scope of an event is large, he hires freelance manpower to execute and provide the said service.  

As a nature of the industry itself, everything is need-based. the way it usually works is:
A client (can be corporate or a wealthy private client) sends out a brief of what he/they intend to celebrate or organize an event -> This brief usually goes out to few event management companies -> these companies propose a plan/theme/budget -> client approves it/negotiates on a budget -> event happens.

Now, the event management companies can approach my friend for service A, either during the proposal phase or after the proposal is approved in which case they have already factored in a service A in their proposal and budgeted a certain amount for it.
Each approach by the event company is considered as an incoming inquiry for hiring his services.

My friend approached me if I can help him out in some way using data science. I have been thinking about but cannot figure out a an idea to model for. Whatever I do I want to ensure that it helps his bottom line. As you can imagine, the current pandemic has destroyed the industry and his business altogether, and since he has some time, he asked me for my help in gathering some insights which will enable him to tweak his processes for the future.

I thought of modeling for his handling of inquiries, wherein I can glean some insight into the probability of an inquiry turning into a business which helps him focus his resources on something which has more probability of generating revenue, but again he and his business are blind to what is going on at the event manager side, he only sees what comes to him and he keeps track of it.

There are other aspects of his business where I believe something can be done, for example, Inventory management & analysis, optimizing operational manpower (he uses inhouse and freelance manpower for his business), but these do not directly help in bottom line, they will help indirectly in a long term and I'm not discounting it, it's just not a priority for him.

So basically what I'm asking is, has anyone modeled for a business that is inherently unpredictable like stock markets and what would you even start looking at which will translate into the bottom line for the company.

5488,gzcirb,The Future: Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production,,"Hello everyone,

I've seen variations of the question ""What is the future of data science?"" asked before, but I think mine is unique enough that it would make for a good discussion in its own post. It's based on a 2020 RStudio Conference presentation mentioned in some other posts, called ""[Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/value-in-data-science-beyond-models-in-production/)"".

In the presentation, the speaker makes the case for why Data Scientists should focus their efforts on providing value through things ***other than*** deploying machine learning to production. As an aside, I think the definition of ""Data Scientist"" he is using is more of a Decision Scientist. The gist of his message is:

* Machine Learning Engineers are likely going to take the ML work that Data Scientists currently do, and will create off-the-shelf ML tools (e.g. AutoML), hence decreasing the need for Data Scientists to do ML.
* Data Engineers are already better than Data Scientists at cleaning data, building pipelines, and warehousing, and so this part of the data science process will be owned by Data Engineers.
* What work does that leave for Data Scientists? What the speaker describes sounds like the work of a Product Analyst:
   * Business Intelligence-type work (metric design, measurement, goal-setting, creating self-service data tools)
   * A small amount of ad-hoc ML modeling
   * Inform business strategy / product design based on data analysis
   * Experimentation
   * The human side of data work - ethics and communication

Here are some questions that the presentation raised for me:

* Do you think his prediction is accurate?
* Will the work of tomorrow‚Äôs Data Scientist be more like today's Product Analyst?
* Do you think his prediction is only true of the tech industry, or does it apply to all industries?",,20,datascience

* How to best manage models that read/write from DBs best way possible?
* Efficient ways to automatically run tests on X independent separate ML models
* Best way to store and access (large) flat files

**Curious to try or work with**

* Kubeflow
* MLflow
* GCP vs AWS vs Azure vs Bluemix - Pros/Cons?

**Best advice**

* If you don't have one already - Design a standardised best practices handbook for your team. You should have a template for a DL project, as well as smaller ML projects. The template should be designed in a way that allows for easy reproducibility and productisation (See previous post I've written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gw8z13/do_you_code_in_object_oriented_way_in_python_when/fsu2p8p?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))
* The rest of your organisation is not necessarily interested in what you are interested in. **Do not focus on mathematical rigor but business objectives.** 
* **Fail fast:** If you cannot get some value relating to the business objective out of the data, post cleaning of course, move on. Summarise findings and what you think is needed to achieve the sought after business objective (Additional data / Other data / Qualitative analysis - Shadow a worker in a function), hypothesise on the reasons for why the relation is not there.

I'm considering using airflow for my ML pipeline on AWS, and I have some questions about basic setup (perhaps noobish).

The airflow server seems like a bit of an overkill, and I'm unsure how to control costs, scaling, python environments and memory/cpu/gpu requirements to each pipeline step?

Alternatively I thought about using it as 'command station', where the ML pipeline just delegates pipeline tasks to fargate and lambda functions - this seems nice, because I can get all the flexibility that I want using those other services, while keeping the server small.  


The reason I want to use airflow is of course because it seems awesome, and I would like to have that overview over the pipes etc. I could just setup a bunch of lambdas/containers, but I would never know if anything had failed.

I have taken a bunch of MOOC courses and had worked on common UCI datasets. I have recently started with Kaggle as well (trying the basic one's right now).

5535,gtv2c9,I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do & where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I‚Äôm working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber‚Äôs ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It‚Äôs actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there‚Äôs a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that‚Äôs why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there‚Äôs no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That‚Äôs when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What‚Äôs really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it‚Äôs at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there‚Äôs a lot of hard & interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that‚Äôs how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber‚Äôs business?**

I‚Äôm on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing & analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber‚Äôs business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It‚Äôs also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here‚Äôs another example:

So, there‚Äôs an optimization & efficiency side of Shared Rides - there‚Äôs always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that‚Äôs this underlying technical tension that‚Äôs always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it‚Äôs a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there‚Äôs more bureaucracy, there‚Äôs more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can‚Äôt imagine doing that currently (given I‚Äôve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you‚Äôre working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I‚Äôm also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I‚Äôm on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We‚Äôre working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I‚Äôm surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There‚Äôs some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it‚Äôs also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that‚Äôs much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you‚Äôre working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn‚Äôt even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there‚Äôs many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there‚Äôs broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I‚Äôm more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you‚Äôre actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there‚Äôs going to be work that‚Äôs a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don‚Äôt look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you‚Äôre not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn‚Äôt study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

5537,gufkqn,How to avoid non-technical errors and bugs ?,,"Dear data-scientists,

**How do you guys prevent non-technical errors and bugs ?**

&#x200B;

I work as a data-scientist in a junior position. My typical workflow consist of the following steps :

 1) the client gives us a problem 

2) think about proper methodology 

3) gather the data necessary to solve the problem 

4) apply some statistical procedures to solve the problem (generally a model) 

5) build a report to send to the client (this report must follow the company's format and standards).

One aspect where I notice I am having difficulties or improvement are in what I will call the non-technical or non-statistical aspects of the workflow above. That is suppose you gather the right data and think about the proper methodology to solve the problem, but then how can I prevent errors on the coding and reporting, for instance:

\- you have the right methodology, but when you are coding the model you assign a wrong variable in the code in some step and then the results are not valid ( for instance you have x\_train and x\_test and you mistakenly do m = x\_test / 2 instead of m = x\_train / 2).

\- on the reporting stage, you exported the wrong results.

These are just examples.

Then you send your report and under scrutiny from your managers or revising things to answer additional questions you find this errors. Then it looks unprofessional to say that the initial results were wrong and you will have to update it. It may not inspire much confidence in your results in the future.

It has been hard for me to find ways to improve in this aspect because these types of errors are hard to predict. When you are coding you are already doing what you think it is correct. Given the time frames we have, it is also unfeasible to double check every single line of code. Also, the problems are generally very diverse in nature, so it is not like you can just adopt an automated or semi-automated methodology that you can work upon and improve, many things you have to build from scratch every time you receive a new project.

5554,gtjczf,EDA revisited,,"As we know, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a very common procedure in the field. We use it mainly to find inconsistencies in the data, to uncover simple patterns that could alter our perceptions of what we are dealing with and to build insightful visualizations. I think we can all agree how this type of information can be critical. What I would like to do here, and I hope you bear with me, is to question what seems to me a overly optimistic application of this technique.

So, a little context. I've been working on a small consultant startup that leverage data science techniques to serve our costumers. As you can probably guess, most of our services involve helping our clients make sense of their data and extract useful information that can maximize their profits. 

In the project I'm in, for 3 months we have been doing EDA and communicating our results through Power Point presentations. Although sometimes we could find something that was potentially interesting, this experience left me questioning the value of EDA when applied in isolation. 

To explicit my argument, let's go through an example: suppose I have a database with 20 variables and my goal is to find ""something interesting"". What we usually do is trying to find correlations between these variables (be it in form of graphs of statistical tests). Suppose that I find a positive correlation between X and Y, though. What is this really saying to me? How is this accounting for confounding variables and how much variance is it capturing? My bosses don't seem to me very concerned with these questions and usually think the finding of a correlation is already an insightful thing to communicate. 

I have been trying to argument with them that no analysis could be detached from previsibility. If this variable is correlated with the outcome, but it isn't helping to predict it, then why are we so focused on it? My concerns are usually met with the same answers: ""it is important to visualize what is happening"", ""we are still exploring our data"". 

This makes me think that my approach (predictability in the first place) is kind of unusual in the field? It appears to me that EDA has became a branch of data science that is not connecting very well with everything and is becoming embedded in some other kind of rules? 

I would love to hear your opinions about it.",,1,datascience

This feature has about a r=0.077 correlation with the outcome (measured from observed data in the training set).

I'm looking to do Multiple Imputation on the missing values and I gather that I basically need to do the following:

1. Choose a single imputation method with a random component (regression with random error term, regression with bootstrap samples, etc.), impute missing values x times to get x separate datasets
2. Do my analysis (build an ML model) x times to get x different sets of results (model parameters)
3. Average the results to get 1 set of model parameters

I was wondering if it would be okay if I just did step 1 and averaged the missing values into 1 complete dataset? I ask because this seems like it may not be worth the hassle for something with only a r=0.077 with the outcome, and coupled with missing values in other features I would end up with a lot of models if I chose this approach.

For those in companies with tight permission policies:

1. How is your access to cloud resources set up?
   1. Are you able to spin up compute resources by yourself (e.g., EC2)?

2. Are you happy with it?

* I am not advocating against IT governance - I think it certainly has a purpose and just giving users ""God privileges"" as u/lacompacida so eloquently referred to is not the answer. What I am interested in is how others (companies) are managing the tradeoff between cybersecurity risks and data scientist's autonomy.
* For example, I think u/SlightBerry brings up what seems like a valid stance - users should be able to deploy resources as needed, and security should be handled not by overseeing what users are spinning up, but by making sure that whatever they spin up is isolated enough not to generate issues.

I am currently wanting to construct predictive models to identify patients who may have a misdiagnosis of a certain disease.

On top of that, I wanted to use different model approaches and use the most accurate model.¬†¬†

I'm currently facing the problem of determining a way to identify the optimal decision threshold to categorize the results of the predictive model as having been misdiagnosed (p=1) or not having been misdiagnosed (p=0). I've read about how we can use Youden's Index to determine the optimal cutoff for a model, but since I'll have multiple models for each of the database, would it make sense to use the SAME cuttoff across all the models and databases or have one for each database (but keep it consistent for each model within the database)? I'm a bit lost on what the best approach is. I haven't been able to find papers that provide detail on how they determine optimal decision thresholds when they have multiple models

P.S. I've read about how you can use the cost of each result (i.e., TP, TN, FP, FN) to determine the threshold, but these values are unknown for my disease of interest.¬†

Because of the mixed data types, I'm not sure if k-means is what I want to use. I tried running a DBSCAN but after it was running for what seemed like forever I gave up.

What clustering algorithm is recommended for such a large number of samples? What would give me a reasonable run time, while also dealing with the fact that I don't just have continuous, numerical data?

For an idea of the data I have, it's basically information about customers.

See what I did there? I posted a link with a bit of an explanation. That's fine. If you want to know more, you have to go to their content on their site. We all do that in our social media feeds. Putting all their content on my site so readers don't need to go to theirs is theft. It doesn't matter if I put the attribution somewhere with the post. No permission=theft.

When another site wants to repost something I've written, they send me a message and ask for permission. That's been the way it is done for the eight years I have been writing. With a site like KDNuggets, I am always good with giving them the OK and not asking for compensation. Some major outlets will ask me to rebuild a post to appeal to their target audience. They have millions of readers. I do that for free too.

I have worked with consulting companies. They want content to drive people to their site as a form of organic marketing. It's usually pretty fluffy, buzzword bingo type posts. I get paid for that. If someone is advertising their services on the site, they are making money off that site and you should too.

I have worked with companies that make products. They want technical content to explain how to use their product in the real world. Again, they use that content to market their products. I get paid for that and you should too.

In the research world, works are cited. There can be a longer quotation from the original work which will have the primary authors' names next to it. Supporting works without quotes will be linked to at the end of the research paper. That's fine. Copy paste research, paraphrasing, releasing implementations as original works, all of that is plagiarism. That gets you blacklisted.

I have posted content that was very close to someone else's. They posted first. I issued an apology and a link to their content. It happens. The right response is to put your hand up and say, ""I messed up. I must have seen their post and that triggered mine."" No excuses. I felt like garbage for doing it.

For instance, ""months since last delinquency"" feature only applies to those borrowers which have a delinquency on their record. Imputing a value of 0 would imply those with no delinquencies are the same as those with an extremely recent delinquency, and imputing a very large value (say 9999) just doesn't sit right with me. My only other idea was to introduce an ordinal feature instead of a numeric one, binning delinquency recency by say ""never"", ""<1 year"", ""1-2 years"", ""3-4 years"" etc. The issue I have with that is I would be deciding the cut off points at the expense of granularity, while it may be better to let the module ""learn"" those cutoff points.

2. Predicting a team's chances of winning the nba draft lottery. Ik that have a worse record gives you a higher chance of winning the lottery, and thus, you get more ping pong balls in the draw. But what would be other features or factors that affect a team's chances of landing the number one pick in the draft?

* exploration that leads to a feature shipped in a product
* explorations that never get shipped
* data analysis for debugging purposes. Let's say we run an A/B test and want to figure out whether we set it up correctly. We won't really share results outside of the team.

I guess different project will possibly get different answers, but let's kick off with these questions:

* where do you store the sidecar data? We store the code on GitHub, but don't want to package the data with the code (security/compliance reasons)
* do you make all your explorations reproducible? For example, a piece of code calls the warehouse. Do you store the snapshot of the data somewhere so you know exactly what was analysed?
* do you store all analysis you perform? For example, exec asks you for some numbers for a PPT
* do you keep track of different experiments? What do you use for that? Notion/Confluence/Gdocs/something ML specific?

5615,gktz5p,What setup should I use for matching and monitoring this project?,,"I need to establish a framework for formatting, matching and tracking changes to a dataset that can only be accessed through a CSV-file. I know how to do that using Excel and VBA, but I was wondering if there isn't a better way.

The problems goes:

1. The goal is to gather a weekly COMPANY : SHARES summary (could be limited to 30 pre-selected companies).
2. Twice a year I get a COMPANY : FUND overview.
3. I can pull an extensive dataset (around 54k obs) structured as FUND : SHARES, but the dataset FUND-string often also includes a lot of noise, such as the company address, company name, telephone etc.
4. To aggregate COMPANY : SHARES, I thus need to match COMPANY : FUND by scanning through the dataset FUND string and match with keywords relating to each specific company (such as a fund name, or the company's own name).
5. Because of the bad quality of the dataset, I will need to manually look at the results of the sorting to adjust the keywords for faulty matches, e.g. a new fund has been attributed because it matched with the company name keyword, but the string also includes some info which makes it clear that it shouldn't have been matched here so I include a non-match keyword filter it out from being matched with that company. This is unfortunate, but bearable as a total of \~200 funds are matched if the number of companies are limited to 30.

I know how to do streamline most of this process with some hassle using Excel Power Query for formatting and importing the CSV, VBA for for matching the data and a Pivot Table for creating a summary. I also know some Python and have SQL experience. I see how SQL would ease the sorting, but I would still need to manually download and format the CSV before feeding it into, say, MS Access. It would be so nice with a setup where I could more easily set the company match/don't-match keywords, see exactly which rows has been matched per company from the dataset, adjust keywords and re-run, and maybe even point out new matches that wasn't there last time it was run.

5642,gfwucw,"Designing a Small, Scalable Data Pipeline on a Budget",,"I work at a small, grassroots nonprofit youth center that provides afterschool and summer camp programming to middle school students in the inner city. I was hired on full-time as their ""Data Analyst,"" however, they had no prior systems, databases, or even spreadsheets, so I inevitably ended up becoming a one-man data team (which I actually am enjoying).

I built a small system of google sheets & forms to collect our student data (attendance, grades, behavior, etc), volunteer data (attendance, skills, etc), and program data (performance evaluation), but I would like to migrate to a more centralized solution that is scalable. The organization plans on scaling and replicating this model around the city, so it would be ideal to have a scalable, replicable data system to accommodate that goal.

My question is this: Are there any open-source/low-cost solutions for building a network of automatable data systems to fit this use-case? Something like a cross-platform app that we can read, write, modify, and delete data with and store in a sort of simplified document system like JSON or Firebase. Since I don't plan on staying here forever, I'd like to build it so it can be used by someone with any level of proficiency in programming.

I recruit pretty heavily with prestigious universities in the U.S. out of their data science programs.

**Issue:**  I find it is difficult as a needle in a haystack to find qualified data scientists with proper communication skills and general business sense.  Many of these recruits have their data science masters degrees and quite of few of them have their bachelors in some sort of business degree. Many others have engineering or statistical backgrounds.

I will often get a stack of dozens of resumes each with all the check marks crossed in terms of programming and courses but when I go to speak to the students it is a near disaster.  I ask them to explain very simple concepts and they often go off on 5 minute answers that are rambling and incoherent.  I need these candidates to be able to communicate across different sides of the business, often times with individuals that have little to no understanding of data science.  It almost feels like I need someone like the guy from office space that took the specs from engineers and handed them off to marketing or sales because the two sides couldn't communicate with each other.

There is another system they use essentially like a service management tool. It takes data from system 1 (e.g. name, phone, tested positive) and uses this additional system to document case notes and provide service work updates (e.g. patient has not exhibited symptoms in three days).

Here's the issue:  the agency is manually exporting data from system one and uploading into system two nightly.  They use SAS for this, but i'm not sure how (I've only ever used SAS for analytics like MLR, cluster analysis, etc.).  

They need a faster and less manual way to integrate the data.  Ideally when one system is updated, the other is also updated much quicker than overnight and less manually (than export, import, matching, etc.).

I have been working as a data analyst for about 3 years and about 2 years ago I switched to Pandas due to how much potential it had to improve my life: I am very bad at cataloging and record keeping, so doing things in Pandas makes everything so traceable and reproducible for me. Plus Excel always becomes super slow for me when the rows surpass 80K.

This week I will give my team members a quick demonstration of Pandas's capabilities. A lot of my team members use Excel for most of their data analysis, so I'd like to show them some handy operations that can be done by Pandas in much shorter time, hence improving our efficiency.

Several operations I have in mind are:

* The magic power of `unstack` to move columns into rows, usually accompanying `set_index()` and `groupby`.
* `df.duplicated()`, esp if I want to find the rows that have duplicate values in some columns, I can do `df[df.duplicated(['A', 'B'], keep=False)]`
* I always have to write a pretty long formula in Excel to find values in column A that is in or not in column B. I love how I can just do `df[~df.colA.isin(df1.colB)]`
* \`merge\` compared to `vlookup` or `indexmatch`

That's about what I have in mind right now. Some other operations like drop\_duplicates() or sum()  can be done not without too much effort in Excel. I don't think I need to talk about groupby() as we all use SQL on a regular basis.

Would anyone care to give me some additional examples please?

Though the remuneration/benefits are good wrt to the data science market in my geography, I  feel that the analytics team members are somehow second class citizens wrt to the core consultants. They get huge bonus, we don t. They can make it to the partner level, we can't. 
The good thing about consulting is that you get exposed to a myriad of problems, so you get quickly get an idea of the needs of an industry. There are 2/3 use cases that come back frequently and honestly, the way we tackle these is pretty basic and leaves a lot of space for further improvement. Indeed, we are generally working on projects with very tight deadlines, pushing us to choose one-shot, quick-win approaches.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased  (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some  point)

* *Master Algorithm* by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis)
* *Weapons of Math Destruction* by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points. I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left
* *Outnumbered* by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not. Also he doesn't push any ML hype, and actually finds there is no proof for some results that got huge media coverage.
* *Architects of Intelligence* \- it's a set of interviews with ML people. What is great about it is that you can see that there is no consensus on the future of the field, and that people who actually have impact have divergent opinions on some topics (like for example on regulation)
* *AI Superpowers* by Kai-Fu Lee - a book by author who was involved with many facets of ML - research, business side (as head of Google China) and venture capital. This one is especially interesting since aside from AI it describes digitalization in China. One of maiin theses is that the US leads in research, but implementation side is tilted towards China because of different business culture (author says that in China companies are not so innovative, as everyone copies from one another another, but that makes its environment more competitive since it doesn't have so strong founder effect where first company to come up with an idea dominates its niche).

5665,gb41m8,Work repeatedly lied to me about ability to transition and now I'm stuck in a role I hate with a bad economy,,"Hello everyone,

So a bit of backstory. I started in my current role roughly nine months ago. During the interview process I made it extremely clear I wanted a data science position (particularly one that involved a lot of machine learning) but the recruiter said there were no openings on data science. She and the others I talked with did say my role would primarily revolve around deploying models into production and not building pipelines and I could transition to data science once there became openings. I did have another full-time data science offer, however it was in a different city. Therefore, I was faced with a tough decision and based both on location and their 'promises' I chose my current role. 

However, in the first few months after starting I realized three things: (1) I wouldn't be deploying any models to production as the DS team had absolutely no models past the prototyping stage (and nine months later they still don't), (2) several others were brought onto the DS team right around when I started, (3) several of the people on DS including the DS lead seemed extremely weak in terms of actual machine learning knowledge. In retrospect this should have been a red-flag but I still hoped I could move off of data engineering and get into data science going. (Also, several of my previous roles had been on contracts, so I wanted to hold down a position for at least a year and not look like a job hopper.)

 Throughout Nov/Dec I tried unsuccessfully to get put on data science projects. This was particularly frustrating as I have expertise in several areas of modeling where the company is struggling. 

Moreover, they transferred several engineers with absolutely no DS background onto DS just because they apparently had nothing better to do with them. However, they kept promising my time would come. Finally, in Feb/Mar they brought me on to a couple of projects aimed at the knowledge graph, apparently because I was the only one in the entire organization with NLP experience. I was happy to work on that but they made it clear that my primary responsibilities for the time being were still data engineering. I asked them if they had plans to hire someone full time to data engineering so I could move over and they said yes. 

Now to the present. They tell me to stop all data science work because they want me 100% focused on data engineering. They come up with some flimsy excuse about the economy and DE needing to be my focus. They also make some references to needing to improve my data engineering performance. (My performance review was perfectly fine. Plus I made it clear to them when I was interviewing DE/ETL was not my strong suit.) Moreover, they still apparently have the resources to hire a full-time data scientist (WTF? they couldn't have hired another data engineer and transitioned me).The data science manager (who still hasn't produced one concrete ML deliverable) literally sits as the product owner of data engineering. At any point he could have prioritized hiring another data engineer so I could move over. I'm beyond frustrated that they have lied to me since day one. However, now the economy is bad and I can't quit outright. I have had  a couple interviews, but I have a number of thing working against me (bad economy, data engineering job title, short current job stay).",,147,datascience

Between then and now, as a function of 1) me moving up in the ranks, 2) macro changes in the entire industry, my bread and butter software went from Excel -> SPSS -> SAS and SQL -> Python.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm trying to be proactive, and start learning one or two new languages.

&#x200B;

I'm not looking for a ""you should just learn X"" answer.  I want to hear some ""IF you learn X, you could do Y.""  I'm more interested in finding a Y I want to do, and then I'll just learn whatever X I need to be able to do it.

&#x200B;

For example, I've been toying around with the idea of learning JavaScript, actually, precisely since most data type people don't know it, and I'm thinking that if I could do some cool interactive or data vizs or web apps, that could distinguish me from my peers.  So if I want to do more reporting and communication, JavaScript maybe would be the way to go?  Anyone have an anecdote that would back that idea up, or knock that idea down?

&#x200B;

Alternatively, I'm thinking about R and Julia.  Right now, I'm a data analyst who only knows how to pandas.  So maybe if I want to go more the science route, I should pick up R or Julia?  (Or: I'm thinking being able to use Shiny and ggplot would let me do more interactives/viz, so have any Pythonistas out there had their life changed by the R, in that way?  Can you tell me about it?)

&#x200B;

I also just started learning bash and awk.  Any data analysis type folks (but not database admin or ETL or IT type folks), discover that learning shell scripting solved a real problem they were having?  Enough to the point that its worth it to learn well?

5686,g8ojeg,Critique/help with the MLOps plan for a small DS team,,"I work for a small (~4 person) data science team within a much larger organization. The team is responsible for making two machine learning models, creating a single set of very important predicted values, and creating reporting and data validation tools relevant to those predicted values. I came on board about 4 months ago with experience in data science, systems administration, and devops. I have a strong linux background and plenty of experience with Docker and Kubernetes. 

I've been asked to improve the existing modeling pipeline. I've come up with a plan that I think is feasible given the organization's goals and (considerable) constraints, but I'm hoping to get feedback on potential pitfalls or things to add from people with more ML/dev ops experience than myself. I also thought it might be fun for this sub to think through what the ideal toolchain might be given a pretty serious set of constraints.

## Goals

- Make our pipeline more robust. No more undetected data issues or breaking commits. Automatic unit and integration tests on all commits/merge requests.
- Improve pipeline transparency and reporting. Make summary and performance statistics about each model more easily available.
- Make testing and comparing new models significantly easier. More clearly tie new model results/objects to the code that produced them.
- Make the whole pipeline run continuously and automatically (given new data or other triggers).

## Constraints

- No cloud infrastructure. Everything has to be on-prem.
- Absolutely no additional money. Zero.
- Need to keep the developer toolchain as light as possible. It has to be usable by a team with limited devops/linux experience.
- Infrastructure can be (and is) linux + Docker based, but it has to be simple enough that if I die it's easy to understand and maintain for someone with a moderate devops background. For the same reason, all infrastructure setup has to be infrastructure as code.
- Any rebuild has to be done within 6 months of one person's full time work. This includes all infrastructure setup, code refactoring, CI/CD setup, and new code.
- The pipeline/modeling itself has to be written in R.

## Tools Available

- Hardware is limited to 2 beefy SQL servers, 2 beefy Ubuntu VMs, and ~6 beefy Windows workstations. 
- We recently upgraded to GitLab Silver for the whole organization and have all the features that go along with it.

## Current Setup

This is a relatively new team that had to get something up and running quickly, so they haven't yet had the time or resources to setup a mature ML pipeline or incorporate many devops best practices. However, they're committed to improving things and making the best system possible, hence why they asked for this plan. The current pipeline is:

1. **Data extraction/processing.** Data is stored entirely in SQL and feature engineering/data extraction is done via SQL views. The view definitions are stored in GitLab. There is one SQL server that is used for both reporting and modeling. Data extraction takes a *very* long time.

2. **Modeling.** The entire pipeline is written in R and is stored in a single, large GitLab repo. Scripts are manually triggered sequentially to run the actual pipeline and modeling. Data ingest/validation, modeling, model validation, and reporting are all roughly part of the same repo. This repo has no unit testing or integration testing.

3. **Reporting.** Reporting is done via R Markdown and a set of Shiny apps that exist separately from the main modeling repo. These reporting applications pull from the same SQL server as the main modeling scripts and report on the predicted values created in the modeling step. Model performance metrics are not available to the reporting apps.

Other notes:

- Intermediate data and model objects are not saved. The model specification and performance statistics of the best performing model are saved to an excel sheet. The predicted values produced by this model are saved back to SQL.

- Testing new models and/or functional forms is done manually by editing the main repo's R code. Model outputs are not tied to specific commits or branches.

## Planned Improvements

Given my constraints, I'd like to make the following improvements:

- Disaggregate the steps of the pipeline into discrete repositories/tasks that can be individually run, tested, and worked on. Add unit testing to each of these repos that runs automatically (via GitLab CI/CD). 
- Create an R package or packages that contains widely used functions and small datasets. Also add unit testing to these repos.
- Create a separate SQL server that mirrors the original server and is used exclusively for reporting.
- Use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) (running in Docker on a VM) to store the intermediate data produced by each step in the pipeline as well the final model objects. This is to prevent people from needing to constantly re-run the same data ingest scripts.
- Use DVC to define clear DAGs that automate the process of running the pipeline and collecting metrics on the results. Upload model metrics to a new table in SQL.
- Again use DVC to tie model output and data to specific commits and branches.
- Using the model summary metrics in both DVC and SQL, add some sort of reporting dashboard (Tableau, Shiny) that facilitates easy comparison of different models.

Those are my immediate thoughts for improvements, but I'm curious to get this sub's take as well. Additionally, I'd love to find an ML ops mentor if someone out there is willing to teach/talk.

First of all both are large companies that are not directly impacted by the disease.

My current team is very resourceful. I work with a group of PhD and masters, who are all extremely bright and have a lot I can learn from. I picked up a ton of knowledge just from being exposed to their work. 

The new offer I received is for a brand new ""data analytics"" team. There are a lot of potential for legitimate data science projects but the team is about .5 - 1 year away from having the right infrastructure (proper data warehouse, tooling, and culture).  Once that's fulfilled, the bulk of work will be in BI, with areas enhanced by machine learning.

A big part of my work is in deploying and executing models, so they are software engineering-heavy in nature as oppose to business-related (which I prefer more).

With the new team, I have more say on directions and the type of projects the team should be doing. There will be more chances of identifying business opportunities and implementing a solution.

I have a Masters and Bachelor's degree in pretty well-known schools, but these degrees aren't actually in data science or software engineering.

5707,g4w6ax,Tell me why I should learn SQL (a little bit of a rant),,"TLDR is at the bottom,

Some background first, I've been working for almost two years as a Junior Data Scientist at a small IoT startup in Massachusetts doing mostly big data analysis with Apache Spark, and ML research/deployment with Amazon SageMaker. With the pandemic going on, and the market the way it is, not many investors are looking to fund new rounds right now, so things are getting pretty tight. Fortunately for me, the executive team is very transparent and let me know it might be time to start looking for something more stable for the time being.

Since then I've had more than a few technical interviews, and a lot of them haven't gone very well, mainly because my SQL skills are extremely basic at best. This isn't a problem at my current company because I use Apache PySpark for everything, I run it on an EMR cluster and it's usually faster than traditional SQL. I usually try to explain Spark to potential employers when they ask me about my SQL skills, but their response is usually like ""ok great, now solve this complex SQL problem anyway"".

In my opinion, PySpark is a faster alternative to raw SQL. I feel a bit frustrated because I feel like employers don't care or believe that I'm just as effective as someone with strong SQL skills.

TLDR:

Why should I learn what in my opinion is a slower alternative (SQL) to a tool I am already skilled with (PySpark)?

Am I wrong to believe I'm as effective as someone who is strong with SQL?

Why do employers insist that I must be skilled with SQL to be a good Data Scientist, even if I explain Apache Spark to them?

# Common Responses:

Really all the responses are in one of three bins

1. You need to learn SQL so you can (\*insert thing you use SQL to do\*)

My response is that I don't, I can use Spark to do almost any SQL task.

2. Just learn SQL it's easy

Yeah, It looks like I'm going to need to do this, but it doesn't really answer my question.

3. People working on a team should all use the same technology for peer review, and so others can pick up where one left off if they leave, plus other reasons. (\*insert harsh sarcasm implying I want everyont on a potential team to switch from SQL to Spark\*)

I come from a collaborative team of scientists who use a variety of tech, from my perspective it seemed reasonable to have a team where not everyone uses the same technology. I guess this is more of a unique case than I was aware of and most companies only hire people who can use the same tech as the team they would be working on. This makes sense to me, I just didn't think it was as obvious/required as others are suggessting.

5711,g1suaz,Is BERT too general for an NLP project with a very limited corpus with very specific contexts?,,"I am working as a Machine Learning dev on an NLP project in the Aerospace industry. To give professional context, prior to this most of my ML work so far has been with structured numerical, ordinal, or categorical data from 3D simulations & video games and NLP is somewhat new to me. 

Specifically the goal is the following

1. Users take a picture of standardized work specifications with a custom app on their phones and then an OCR technology recognizes the text in the picture. (The OCR tech is already working)
2. A custom NLP tech classifies the text in the picture into specific classes and then populates a form in the app with the recognized text.

I am working on the NLP side and trying to decide which word embedding to use. The corpus for this project have meanings that are very specific to an Aerospace context (for example ""ceiling"" would relate to almost exclusively to the maximum altitude of an aircraft and NOT walls/floor/etc. ) and the amount of unique words on the work orders is likely no more than 2500-4000.

BERT's bidirectional approach seems like it would lead in general to accurate understanding of context, but I'm wondering if the pre-trained BERT models would be far too general an application like this where the context is ultra-specific.

My current job is about as close to my dream job as it gets. I work on interesting problems and I genuinely enjoy the work.

1. I only have a bachelor's degree. It's a **solid** bachelors degree (computer science and stats from an ivy), but a bachelor nonetheless. Literally every data science manager i can think of has at least a master's. I'm confident that I *could* make progress at my current company, but at places like google they won't even hire a data scientist without a masters. I'm paying down lots of student debt right now and couldn't dream of going another 100k in the hole. From what I can tell, software engineering doesn't have this hard education cutoff.
2. I write next to no production code. I crank out analyses using jupyter notebooks and SQL like my hair is on fire, but only my final recommendations are seen. Combining this with a recent influx of MBAs into the field, I worry that I'm on track to a not-so-technical career path. Like consultant or something. Not necessarily bad, but I fell in love with writing code before I was a data scientist.
3. The big advances in analytics seem to be coming from building platforms, services, etc. I think I'm naturally inclined to build things and I enjoy this kind of work. Down the road, the combination of these two kinds of data science (business-focus and engineering-focused ) would give me a huge leg up.

Should I make the jump? I'm in my early 30s and I'm just not jazzed about dropping a mortgage down payment for another degree just for the ability to advance. I'd rather leverage what I've learned as a data scientist as a leg up on a career path that doesn't have the same barrier to entry.

# Intuition

Once upon a time, there was a task given (this was a decade back when excel & vlookup were the 2 of 3 famous terms in the world of analytics).  
As the story goes‚Ä¶ this was for a retail industry, we did some analytics around the products that customers are purchasing. 1. What are the products they are looking at & searching? 2. What are the commonalities, pattern, segmentation etc etc.  
End of the day, we had to analyse hundreds of thousands of transactions; thousands of people, their purchase and invoices;

We found an interesting pattern happening very often. When people shop in the evening between 6 and 9. **Customers who buy diapers also buy beer**.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syeee0ym4rs41.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=80befea480ce0ec2391ebfdbed336a776433e30b

But, this insight was like out of the blue completely as these 2 products are completely not connected.  
***Why would somebody buy beer when they‚Äôre buying diapers or why buy diapers when they‚Äôre buying beer!!!***  
So that was the fact we came across in the data and the explanations as fact. **One of the plausible explanations we gave;** In the evenings, when the husband gets home and when they take care of their baby; they sometimes find that they run out of diapers and who has to go pick up the diapers.. well, the husband. The wife sends husband to go pick up the diapers and **while he is picking up the diapers because its already after work hours, he also picks up some beer. Right.**

And this plausible explanation might be logical or not be. This is something you can‚Äôt really think of it just by yourself but that comes from the data.

As I‚Äôve highlighted this in my previous [***post***](https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7), based on certain insights derived from data; a supermarket or retail industry can decide how to arrange products in your shelf **whether you run an e-commerce store to rank & show your products in your virtual shelf or a superstore to put these 2 products to entice people while shopping.**

So there is a lot of interesting marketing tactics that are using based on this data. But the question is; how do you get to this data?

>*You may read :*[*A beginner‚Äôs guide to understanding recommendation system*](https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7)

**And one of the ways to get to it is leveraging analytics use apriori algorithm.**

# Problem Statement

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on one‚Äôs needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:  
*Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.*  
*Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.*  
*Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.*  
*X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.*

Association rules are ‚Äúif-then rules‚Äù with two measures which quantify the support and confidence of the rule for a given data set. Having their origin in market basket analysis, association rules are now one of the most popular tools in data mining. This popularity is to a large part due to the availability of efficient algorithms. The first and arguably most influential algorithm for efficient association rule discovery is Apriori.

**Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.**  
Folks from healthcare industry, are you reading this ?

# Definition

Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. There are three common ways to measure association.

1. **Support:**  
This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

2. **2. Confidence:**  
This will highlight how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In diagram below, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

&#x200B;

**3. Lift:**  
Table below how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In diagram below, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.

**Association Rule Mining**  
Now that we understand how to quantify the importance of association of products within an itemset, the next step is to generate rules from the entire list of items and identify the most important ones. This is not as simple as it might sound. Supermarkets will have hundred of thousands of different products in store. After some simple calculations, it can be shown that just 10 products will lead to 57000 rules!! And this number increases exponentially with the increase in number of items.  
Finding lift values for each of these will get computationally very very expensive. How to deal with this problem? How to come up with a set of most important association rules to be considered? Apriori algorithm comes to our rescue for this.

**Lets build an efficient recommendation system in R studio**

1. Load data
2. Install apriori
3. Data pre-processing | Decode sparse matrix | Plot
4. Train & Test
5. Visualize

In this example, we will work on a sample dataset from a grocery store, understand the business problem, and ways to optimize the sales using apriori algorithm leveraging machine learning.

My company provides retailers with pricing data collected by employees in the field. I am one of those Field Data Collectors. Basically I'm assigned several jobs at different stores throughout the week. Some jobs repeat weekly, or monthly, or quarterly. Some jobs require the collecting of certain items on a list, some requiring scanning every item in a category and collecting those prices. 

An example: every week Bullseye wants to know how Walcarts prices a specific 500 items at 20 different stores in the area. I'm assigned 3 stores, go into each of those stores and find the items, scan them, and input the prices. If that store does not carry the exact item I indicate it. Different DCs are assigned the different locations.

I don't even know what happens in my own company after I upload my job to submit the data i've collected, let alone what the retailer does with the data they're given. 

I'm just curious, why do these major retailers (and even some minor more local/ region specific retailers) contract with our company to get this data? What do they use it for? The company website sells itself as ""Our clients benefit from omni-channel, normalized, and actionable Pricing Intelligence at massive scale to inform on-target pricing strategy and¬†maximize business impact."" What does that even mean? 

Another question I have, who benefits most from this data? Is it only the corporations, or is there any benefit to the consumer as well? 

Also, when Bullseye wants pricing from Walcarts, Walcarts sends us to a Rokger banner, and Rokger finally asks for Bullseye data, does that really end up benefiting anybody? They're all getting data from eachother in a circular manner.

- Set up a clean environment. Have your desk clear. If possible be alone in the room, where no one in your family will be passing by. Set boundaries with them, telling them that you will be working so please no interruptions if it is not needed. 

- Follow your normal routine at your job. Take breaks, do the pauses you normally do and when finishing your job totally disconnect from work. Avoid reading and responding to emails in the evening.  

- Set clear goals. The uncertainty makes us work with no direction. Create specific and objective goals, give them a time frame and start each day with the task which needs a bigger effort from you.

**Tl;dr** the company that just hired me is not ready for data scientists. I‚Äôm being asked to do things that are very far from my expertise, but I also have no other job prospects. I also really like the field the app is in, have a ton of time while under quarantine, and the motivation to try and make as much of this work as possible. Any help is appreciated.

\----

I‚Äôm a data science bootcamp graduate (I know, I know. I apologize for existing.) and not surprisingly have been struggling to find my entry into the field, but I was getting interviews, particularly in my area/domain of interest. Then the virus hit the US and all my prospects shriveled, except for one. It‚Äôs a startup in my domain, an app where users would make decisions regarding a particular ‚Äúscore‚Äù.

&#x200B;

Originally, we had discussed integrating with his development team (working with them on an initial model of the aforementioned ‚Äúscore‚Äù) - then, as the initial model is productionalized, I would switch to data-driven content creation (data viz, dashboards, articles and presentations for non-tech users) to help in communicating technical aspects the product internally, and marketing the product externally, an area of the field I enjoy. Great.

&#x200B;

Well, we negotiated equity, and I sign-on, and it turns out I‚Äôm the first (and only) full-time employee. The development team is all freelance. The company has no data engineers, so the founder has asked me for guidance on setting up historical data from an API on our own servers. The extent of my data engineering knowledge is: I‚Äôve used SQL to connect to preexisting architectures, and I‚Äôve seen people use Spark/Hive/Hadoop. I‚Äôm researching Apache Airflow like a madman, but (obviously) in way over my head.

&#x200B;

He also wants me to spearhead the marketing campaign. There is no website. There is no chosen domain. But I‚Äôve had dozens of pages of ‚Äúmarketing book notes‚Äù delivered to me, and I‚Äôm supposed to turn it into some kind of plan for my own content, then execute said plan. He wants me to be the lead on creating strategic partnerships within the industry. While I love ""making things"" (I'm also a YT/podcast content creator for fun), I‚Äôm not a marketer at whatsoever and don't have some big list of in-industry contacts, so... I‚Äôm just completely in the dark there.

I know a ton of people would just peace out and look for another job, but since I've got no other options at the moment: for those who have been in similar situations and stuck it out: who‚Äôve dealt with a founder/boss with unrealistic expectations re: what one entry-level data scientist can do, I‚Äôd love to hear how you went about A) your work (what tools/resources) you saught-out and B) how you handled communicating unrealistic expectations while still doing your level-best to rise to the occasion.

* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the ‚Äúwhole board‚Äù they‚Äôre seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you‚Äôve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren‚Äôt taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**EDIT TO ADD:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven‚Äôt developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You‚Äôd be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful.

5743,fuzwli,htmlcreator: build standalone HTML documents from Python,,"I often find myself in need to share my findings (mainly tables and pictures) with collaborators. When I started working in Data Science I was using Jupyter Notebook a lot, so I usually exported .ipynb to .html and voil√†. But over years I switched completely from notebooks to scripts (even though I love new Jupyter Lab). Without notebooks, creating standalone HTML file with images and tables wasn't easy anymore. I couldn't find simple Python package to help me with that, so I created my own one: [htmlcreator](https://pypi.org/project/htmlcreator).

It exposes simple API for creating standalone HTML files from Python code containing text, images and tables embedded inside. It has also default styling (CSS), so everything looks nicer. I've been using it for around 2 years now and recently decided to publish it, so others can use it too.

see [examples/1_build_first_document.py](https://github.com/ar-nowaczynski/htmlcreator/blob/master/examples/1_build_first_document.py) and its output: [examples/1_first_document.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ar-nowaczynski/htmlcreator/blob/master/examples/1_first_document.html)

5745,fv1itk,Text classification service API or docker image recommendations,,"I have a website that organizes factual claims and allows the community to rate them based on objective qualities.  One current feature associated with each claim is called ""topics"".  I'm considering a redesign where topics are calculated automatically based on the contents of the claim, its sources, and its evidence provided.

Technology is no bother for me, as I built the website from the ground up.  However, I know next to nothing about data science.  I've spent most of today researching where I even need to begin.

What I think I'm looking for is called Text Classification.  Here's what I imagine my process would look like.

1. Certain users sometimes enter topics with each claim.  When they do, the back-end will take that opportunity to train a model with the user provided topics.  Maybe I have to spend some time training the model myself, which is fine.  Who trains it doesn't matter, but I would like the model to be trained against a specific set of topics.  This could eventually be in the thousands.
2. Certain users take advantage of auto-tagging of topics, and the claim document is then submitted to the text classification service by the back-end where it will predict one to many topics automatically.
3. Depending on other services provided by the text classification solution, it may also be used for fuzzy searching and trending topics.

Here's where I'm uncertain:

1. Am I on the right track with text classification as the right solution to this problem?  I've seen several tools for ""text annotation"" but those seem more interactive, and tied to recognizing existing named entities, whereas I want to train the model against a more tailored lexicon (train a document against a topic/category/label/whatever).
2. Most examples I saw while researching only used one topic to train one document, and got only one topic in return when predicting a document.  I am looking for a solution where I can provide many topics per doc in training, and get many topics back when predicting.
3. Does training end, or is it continuous?  Is there such a thing as over-training?  I'd also need to factor in storage size for trained topics, especially if it is continuous.
4. Can text classification be used to determine topics that are trending and fading?  Or, is that a different data science approach/solution?
5. I think I found what I need in GCP [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) Natural Languare Processing API, but it is too expensive ($5 per 1000 doc predictions!?).
6. And, assuming I'm on the right track with all of this, does anyone know of any production-ready service API's or docker images out there, or even libraries I could integrate with or build a service around?  I'm technology agnostic and am comfortable in many languages including python.  But, most everything I've found seems one-off, white-paper-ish, experimental, small-scale (i.e. in-memory only), etc...  Here are the ones that seemed closest to what I want to do:
   1. [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) \- node toolsuite with most everything I think I need, but would need to build up persistence storage and run benchmarking to assess its scalability.
   2. [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy) \- Seems more UI human interaction focused, rather than API driven.  And, not sure about custom lexicon given the emphasis on general annotation.
   3. [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) \- Same comments as [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy), but  got excited when I saw they had a docker image. Didn't seem like the right solution for my problem, though.
   4. [cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/) \- AWS based, service based, but wasn't clear on how they offer text classification at all.  I wondered if I could makeshift their sentiment analysis just using a custom  topics.  I could work with AWS, but it's not my first choice
   5. [monkeylearn.com](https://monkeylearn.com) and various other services that aren't upfront about pricing or are just too expensive.
   6. [xgboost.readthedocs.io](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) \- here's one that I believe is production ready and \*probably\*, but I have a hard time figuring out what the heck it does or what I do with it!
   7. [klassify](https://github.com/fatiherikli/klassify) \- This one seemed the most straightforward, and closest to what I'm trying to do, has a docker image, works with redis, and so it seems scalable.  But, I wasn't sure if anyone had any experience with it or if it meets my requirement of pulling multiple topics out of one document (at first glance it only seems to work with one).

Appreciate any help on the matter!  I have a [sandbox](https://sandbox.thinkards.org) up if that helps gauge what the website abilities are.  I'm aware the UI/UX needs some work, and I am working on it (that's at least two things I'm clueless on)!

I have a question. I'm thinking about doing a minor in data science and later on maby a master. I'm doing a bachelor in marketing, and right now I'm doing an internship in marketing insights (research). I have really taken an interest in data and statistics and also data science. I would love to learn more about it but there is one thing holding me back.

 I am dyslectic and I have discalculia, both diagnosed at a very young age. There both not as severe now that I'm older. Mainly I'm bad at spelling and mental arithmetics. But I will also  misread numbers or letters or remember them wrong fairly often. So this might lead to small errors here and there.

On my current internship it's not a super big deal because we always look over everyone's work before sending it out anyway. 

But I guess my question is to anyone reading, is it a stupid idea to get into data science with these learning disabilities because I'm probably more prone to making errors? 
If there is anyone working (or studying) in data science who is dyslectic or has discalculia I would love to hear about your experience.

With the current lockdown for COVID, I found myself with a decent amount of free time on my hands that I wish to repurpose for my own growth. 

I'm a junior data scientist, working more on the MLE side of things (but also building models). 

I seek advice regarding the following: 

  
A. I can invest this out-of-work time to develop my current work skills:   

- Python: improve from intermediate+ (design and write better OOP, develop a more software dev style of coding)   

- Statistics: Still using out of college knowledge, can get more developed at abstraction, intuition, and baking in more stats in my general intuition (that comes with time and practice but I feel I can learn more on this end)   

- Cloud Dev (aka) MLOps: I've been some work on that end, seems very interesting to me as I come from an engineering background


B. Pick up a completely new skill: Deep Learning: 
I know just enough from school to say I trained a Neural Network, I'm not familiar with the details, the Keras/PyTorch feud nor advanced hyperparameter tunning. Either I can invest in the famous Coursera DL bundle, or Udacity or whichever fits.

While I'm more of a *heavy* lurker, /r/datascience has always been an excellent source of discovery and insights for Data Scientists both new and experienced.

I've seen a lot of frustrations when it comes to making Data Science effective in an organization. Issues like:

- Complicated tooling and configurations
- Lack of pipeline and data testing
- Lack of visibility into projects as they start to expand in complexity
- Being forced to wear hats for every step of the end-to-end data cycle
- Different data teams operating in silos
- Lack of access to required cloud resources
- Projects rarely making it to production

All of these issues make it difficult for a Data Science team to drive value and build trust. But I don't think it should have to be that way.

With these frustrations in mind, I set out to build a workflow platform - [Shipyard](https://www.shipyardapp.com) - that helps eliminate the friction of getting solutions to production so Data Scientists can focus more on Data, not DevOps.

To be brief, we've designed the platform to:

- Launch solutions with no DevOps or complicated setups involved. We're cloud-native and handle all scaling on your behalf.
- Orchestrate solutions across teams to create complex pipelines with no edits or additions to your code.
- Monitor and alert on the status of hundreds of solutions for peace of mind.
- Share custom, repeatable solutions with the larger organization using Blueprints.

We're still in the early stages, so I'm looking for anyone that might be interested in testing us out and providing feedback. It's 100% free right now in exchange for your feedback. If you're interested, let me know.

5760,fsej3k,Estimating Covid-19 Infections based on Reported Deaths,,"Since the number of test varies significantly between individual countries, and no country is is even close to reaching 100% test coverage, the reported infections have to be taken with a gigantic grain of salt. However, reported deaths should be much more accurate, since everybody who dies as a consequence of a covid infection pretty much has to be ""in the system"".

So I tried to find a way to ""backtrack"" actual infection numbers based on reported deaths and some other parameters. The calculation could look something like this:

**Assumptions**

* Number of infections is doubling every 3 days
* It takes on average 12 days from infection to death
* Case fatality rate is 2.5%
* There are 100 new deaths reported today

**Calclulation**

* We know, that the people who died today have been infected about 12 days ago. Since 2.5% of infected people die, we can now calculate the number of people who were newly infected 12 days ago with n=100/0.025 = 4000
* We know, that the number of infections doubles every 3 days. Therefore, the number of newly infected people today has to equate, all things being equal, 2^((12 / 3)) = 16 times the amount of 12 days ago. Thus, we can assume that, today 16\*4000=64000 people will be infected
* We can run this calculation for every date, resulting in a timeseries of (new)infections
* We can take the cumulative sum of that timeseries to retrieve the final timeseries of cumulative total estimated infections

&#x200B;

I created a little tool using streamlit to visualize the timeseries and play around with the assumptions for different countries:

I'm serious. Tech is one-fourth of the cost or less.

Given how frequently data scientists can need to deal with very large datasets, are there any good alternatives to pandas that doesn't do this, or ways around this, etc?

5784,fqzhwd,What‚Äôs the simplest way I should‚Äôve answered this conceptual statistics/methodology question in my interview (Market Analyst)?,,"Hey all,

So brief summary, I applied for a Market Analyst position (first analyst position in general) and essentially after proving my SQL skills in a few, very tedious interviews beforehand, made it to the final interview (via video, woo!)

It was this last question in this final interview that just threw me off of everything, as I have like no statistical experience/knowledge (except for taking one stats class in early college lol). 

So I know this is probably simpler than I made it out to be in my head, but it being in the moment, and again, my lack of statistical knowledge in general, I literally was stumped. 


Essentially here‚Äôs what I was given:

Upon past email marketing survey efforts to a test send group of 10,000 customers, we had a 20% response rate. We then had a control group to 1,000 customers, and had a response rate of 15% with them. 

We want to lower the control group and yet, be confident we can measure the response rate with statistical significance. What would you recommend?


So basically, I pulled stuff out my ass with things like ‚Äúfurther personalization of the designs of these email surveys as we decrease the control group size, as well as trigger(automate) emails to send surveys out in a more timely manner‚Äù (LOL) etc etc; knowing damn well that this problem isn‚Äôt really focused on the process or design of the survey itself.

They tried giving me a hint saying that this is supposed to be conceptual and there‚Äôs no one right answer and they don‚Äôt need exact calculations or anything but more of the statistical thought process one would go through for this experiment.


The only stats I remember was like simple t-tests (one sample and independent samples) but I‚Äôm rusty in both concepts and definitely need to go back and refresh every little thing about them. Plus, wasn‚Äôt even sure if this scenario even constitutes those two tests lol. 

I was feeling so good up until then since literally all of the other interviews and questions were about SQL and they were really impressed by my queries and such. And on top of that, they said most of the day to day is SQL so I felt like this might be my first analyst position I could finally land.

But what‚Äôs done is done and as I wait for a decision, I wanted to see what thought process you guys would‚Äôve essentially said (in simplest terms?) so that I can learn and just be able to familiarize myself with some of these terminologies for future references.

Thanks in advance for any input on the matter~

EDIT: should‚Äôve added their response when I asked for general clarification:


‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs say whatever lower control group we chose, we saw that the new response rate was 10%. How do we know that that given response rate can be trusted and significant? ‚Äú

‚ÄúAgain, don‚Äôt focus on the actual value of the new response rate. It could be 15% or 20%. We just wanted to know how you‚Äôd go about saying that this response rate was not just an anomoly but can be trusted in the sense that in the future if we wanted to use the same control group number then we can expect that same response rate?‚Äù",,2,datascience

As you all know, governments across the planet are struggling to contain the spread of Covid-19. The reason behind this is simple: things are moving too quickly making it extremely difficult to keep track of what is happening and where it is happening. The answer is simple: **DATA**!

Until treatments and vaccines are developed, data is our greatest weapon against Covid-19, and it‚Äôs about time we used it. We are launching a global survey to collect and analyze data from citizens across the planet - the first of its kind in history- to help governments and our communities in their battle against the greatest challenge of the Internet Age.

All we are asking for is four minutes of your time to share this post and fill out this simple, completely anonymous survey that can save thousands, if not millions of lives, as well as the livelihoods of most small business owners and day laborers. If you answer these questions as accurately as possible, you will provide us with extremely valuable information that can reveal where outbreak zones are and how they have been developing over the past few weeks. That means seeing an early end to the mass quarantine measures currently being employed and enforced around the planet.

**How?** Well, for example, if thirty people on your block report that they have symptoms consistent with Covid-19, your local government will be able to act quickly to treat patients, contain the local spread, and warn those on your block to take extra steps to safeguard themselves. You yourself will be more cautious and will have a direct view of your neighborhood's status regarding the coronavirus.

Imagine the network effect, and application of wisdom of the crowd to actually get more insight and provide a new angle to specialist & data analysts to come-up with the most impactful solutions.

All of this anonymous information will be released daily on Kaggle and Github so that researchers, data scientists, companies and governments can quickly access and analyze it.

Five algorithms and streamlined onboarding are only some of the major new features delivered in the [0.11 release](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/tag/v0.11.0) of the library, with substantial API, documentation and demo improvements to support users in running and exploring StellarGraph functionality.

New algorithms include:

* Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them.
* Deep Graph Infomax: performs unsupervised node representation learning.
* Temporal Random Walks (Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings): random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred.
* ComplEx: computes multiplicative complex-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.
* DistMult: computes multiplicative real-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/755)

A sixth algorithm remains under active development, but is available in this release as an experimental preview:

* GCNSupervisedGraphClassification: supervised graph classification model based on Graph Convolutional layers (GCN).

The new release incorporates extensive enhancements and bug fixes, some of which include: 

* StellarGraph.to\_adjacency\_matrix is at least 15 times faster on undirected graphs[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/932)
* ClusterNodeGenerator is noticeably faster, reducing the time taken to train and predict with a ClusterGCN model 
* Addition of a subgraph method for computing a node-induced subgraph
* Addition of a connected\_components method for computing the nodes involved in each connected component in a StellarGraph
* The info method has been improved for heterogeneous graphs with many types and also shows information about the size and type of each node type's feature vectors
* Four new datasets added to stellargraph.datasets
* Neo4j functionality is now tested on CI
* Example Jupyter notebooks can now be run directly in Google Colab and Binder
* New notebooks demonstrating how to construct a StellarGraph object from Pandas, and from NetworkX.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) to access StellarGraph and explore these enhancements. Details for breaking changes can also be reviewed here.

The feedback I received from the advisers asks me how understanding this data process impacts the way we build a user centered technical solution.

I'm a bit stumped on what to say and would appreciate some thoughts. So far the only thing I've come up with is that it helps us break down the problem we are trying to address.",,8,datascience
5813,fpmubr,How do you keep local data files ? Do you sync them up to a database / google drive? I'm confused about workflow,,"
The problem is that we sync our code up with git, but the data is stored
locally. So that if someone else wants to run the code or something there's
an issue.

The data comes from a mixture of sources

* most is from Google Storage
* some is from data scraping / whatever during the project
* some is processed data

I was thinking about having a local directory rsynced up to the data storage,
and sync on git pushes with a git hook.

An issue with this is that there would be duplication of data, for example,
if I have some `data.csv`, then it might originally be located at

```
storage/bucket_1/data.csv
```
I pull this down to my local project
```
project/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
and then I sync my local data up to storage again, putting it at
```
storage/bucket_2/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
So that data now exists in two places, which isn't so great.

I'm not aware of a process to prevent this though and would appreciate any
thoughts/considerations that others have.

If you are bored and need something to fill your time I got the perfect solution for you. Could you fill out a questionnaire for a study I am doing? My data collection is not going well and I really need some participants. Furthermore, some of the items are pretty interesting and could help you dealing with the quarantine boredom (if it is present). So it's basically a win/win. My study is about the relationship between future self-continuity (do we feel connected to our future self or not) and moral decision making. In other words, I want to see whether the degree of our perceived connectedness to ourselves in the future is related to decisions we make about moral dilemmas.

**The questionnaire is for Italian speakers only.** This is an exploratory study and it would require approximately 40 minutes of your time. If you are interested you can check out the link below:

5825,fpctf3,Mahalanobis Distance out of two other Mahalanobis Distances,,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, but it seemed like the best one since Mahalanobis distance seems to be used for Machine Learning as well. This is for a work in Management though, so not Data Science per se, more Data Science adjacent I suppose.

After getting my head around the Mahalanobis distance, I found statistical significance in the variables I am using calculated with it. There is a pretty established author that measures the same thing I am trying to, and they publish their Mahalanobis Distances, but not their component variables, being that they use different variables to measure this construct. Their variables, and process of recovery is so obscure that it is unlikely that I'd be able to access them myself.

So, to get to the point as quickly as possible, I've was wondering if it is even worth it to look into if it is theoretically sound to aggregate two Mahalanobis Distances with the Mahalanobis Distance, for the same subjects. 

Or would it be better for me to use those my variables and include that distance as another variable. In the same vein, should some ponderation be made regarding how many variables each Mahalanobis distance computes?

This is a selection of maths courses, collections of courses, and specializations which are freely available online, and which can help achieve your data science mathematics goals. They have been separated into the broad topics of mathematical foundations, algebra, calculus, statistics & probability, and those especially relevant to data science & machine learning.

Take a look at the list and closer inspect those which may be of interest to you. I hope you find something useful.

¬†
Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford¬†(course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford¬†(course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box ‚Äì a valuable ability in today‚Äôs world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

High School Mathematics, MIT¬†(collection of courses)
In this section we have provided a collection of mathematics courses and resources from across MIT. Some are materials that were used to teach MIT undergraduates, while others were designed specifically for high school students.

¬†
Algebra

These algebra courses run the gamut from introductory algebra to linear models and matrix algebra. Algebra is helpful in computation and data science generally, and encompasses some of the main concepts in powering some machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Algebra I, Khan Academy¬†(course)
Course covers algebra foundations, solving equations & inequalities, working with units, linear equations & graphs, forms of linear equations, systems of equations, inequalities (systems & graphs), functions, sequences, absolute value & piecewise functions, exponents & radicals, exponential growth & decay, quadratics (multiplying & factoring), quadratic functions & equations, irrational numbers.

Algebra II, Khan Academy¬†(course)
Course covers polynomial arithmetic, complex numbers, polynomial factorization, polynomial division, polynomial graphs, rational exponents & radicals, exponential models, logarithms, transformations of functions, equations, trigonometry, modeling, rational functions.

Linear Algebra, MIT¬†(course)
This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices.

Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers, University of Texas at Austin¬†(course)
Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.

Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra, Harvard¬†(course)
In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.

Statistics & Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy¬†(course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT¬†(course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard¬†(course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT¬†(course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology¬†(course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University¬†(course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, Penn State¬†(course)
Courseware for a pair of related courses covers introduction to probability, discrete distributions, continuous distributions, bivariate distributions, ditributions of functions of random variables, estimation, hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, bayesian methods, and more.

Mathematics for Data Science & Machine Learning

These are mathematics topics directly related to data science and machine learning. They may include material from courses above, and may also be more elementary than some of above as well. However, they can be useful for brushing up on material you may not have studied in a while, and which is especially pertinent to the practice of data science. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Data Science Math Skills, Duke University¬†(course)
Data science courses contain math‚Äîno avoiding that! This course is designed to teach learners the basic math you will need in order to be successful in almost any data science math course and was created for learners who have basic math skills but may not have taken algebra or pre-calculus. Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft¬†(course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London¬†(specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it‚Äôs used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",,480,datascience
5859,fo3d8f,Big data or data engineering for NLP?,,"I am trying to find if  it makes sense that they often happen together: NLP, and data engineering or big data techniques (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, and Scala)

One classic example in Hadoop MapReduce is word count. I guess that doesn't count as NLP.

1. In NLP industrial positions, do natural language data often need data engineering or big data techniques, i.e. do natural language data often come as ""big data""? 

   Internet search engines likely require big data of natural language, but I guess there  are very few Internet search engine job positions.  Do most information retrieval positions also need to worry about big data? How about  other NLP applications.?

2. Natural languages are unstructured data. However, https://www.dataversity.net/natural-language-processing-big-data-powerful-combination/ said in 2014:

  > As developed as big data analytics have become, they still really only excel at managing structured information.


  Have big data or data engineering techniques evolve for NLP already? If yes, how well are  NLP aware big data or data engineering techniques received in industry?


  Is it more often to convert natural language data to structured data, and then apply big data or data engineering techniques, or to apply  NLP aware big data or data engineering techniques directly to NLP big data?

3. Some other observerations and thoughts?

Our lab will focus on **understanding the neurocognitive processes that allow for the emergence of cognitive control** (how the human brain/mind monitors and adapts itself overtime to achieve task goals). Moreover, we will seek to understand how this system develops across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. Towards this end, methods that I currently employ, include: (single-trial) ERP analyses, time-frequency analyses of EEG (power and phase relations), source-localization of EEG, traditional fMRI approaches (GLM-based), and basic computational modeling (drift-diffusion models). Our lab is currently purchasing a high-density EEG system and FIU houses an fMRI scanner.

I am **seeking collaborators** that may or may not currently work in the fields of psychology or neuroscience, but that have at least some **expertise in one or more of the following domains: data science, advanced signal processing, machine learning, computational modeling, graph-theoretic/network analysis.** *I am most interested in finding collaborators that can help generate the best science; location, status, affiliation, or degrees earned are not important.* I also intend to take on at least one PhD student this fall and welcome responses from prospective students.

The scientific goal of this collaboration will be to combine skillsets in order to test novel hypotheses regarding the human cognitive control system, its developmental trajectory across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. At a practical level, we would seek to produce high-impact publications and to generate pilot data for pursuing collaborative grant proposals. **Depending on the situation, initial funding may be available for potential collaborators, consultants, or contractors.**

A few months ago, I asked a question on the forum -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ekawho/how\_do\_you\_track\_and\_share\_your\_data\_reports/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ekawho/how_do_you_track_and_share_your_data_reports/)   
Based on your feedback, I and my friends have now built a free tool that can be used to publish, track, and share data visualizations via APIs from anywhere (a Jupyter notebook, a script or an application) and store them in our web application (which is also mobile friendly). The current version supports Python and R as programming languages, and Matplotlib, Ggplot2, Plotly and Bokeh as plotting libraries.   
Here is a tutorial on how to use the library with the help of an example.

We think there is a lot more one can offer to improve the current process of a collaborative exploration of data visualization for teams. As basic as our current solution is, we are currently working on releasing new features such as - Organizing the charts into dashboards - User groups and permission management - Plugins for spreadsheets such as Google docs and MS Excel - Dynamic plots and dashboard that fetches data from a data source and can be scheduled to update regularly - A mobile application to access the visualizations, - On-prem options

We would love to hear about your challenges in the area of collaboration around data visualization, and receive any feedback on what we currently have.",,32,datascience

**Objective:** Create kind of an Hackaton/program with a company where at the end of the day Data is transformed into relevant business insights. Those insights will be capitalized to generate possible new business models.

**Some questions about:**

**People:** 

\- Should we have several teams working with data? how many people per team, 1 or more? how can they work together - can we assign several roles like: 1 to cross data, 1 to clean the data, etc (is this stupid? lol) ?

\- Are these people data scientists only? Should we have 1 business guy per team to give a different perspective?

\- Should we have Data Scientists in the morning and then business people during the evening?

**Data:** 

\- Should we start with raw data?

\- All the teams should start with the same Data?

\- Should we try to cross data from company with some public government data or other sources?

**Program:** 

\- A morning, 12h, 24h, 2 days? How much time do we need?

\- Should we specify some avenues to explore or let them search for everything?

\- What are the things I have to take into account?

&#x200B;

I Know this is all too broad, vague, open and your answer will be ""It all depends on what you want"", but what I need here is your expertise and sensitivity. If it was you, what would you do, how and why? Do you have anything that had been done before as a good example?

I am working as Data Scientist for 2 years in a startup in Bangalore, including internship where most of my work had data cleaning and data wrangling profile. It has been 1.5 years working as one. Now, the current scenario due to funding and new clients has shifted towards more challenging projects. One of them is Super Resolution and OCR (Japanese, has very little literature to go through ) and Super Resolution for text images for English and Japanese (again , a challenging and subjective as per buisness problem). The thing is the management thinks that if a paper is published for super resolution it will work on our data too, plus the Data science manager is sort of ""yes sir"" guy and makes us work on simply hit and trial, as of two years one thing I am sure that Data Science is not just simply trying anything till we reach accuracy without going through in details. The learning curve has just gone down to trying tessarct, kraken etc and same goes for Super resolution, just feed the data and see it works or not. I want to tell the management that it is not worth and we need a better resource on ML and DL who can actually break it down and guide us in a more logical and systematic direction instead of just trying different paper with a dataset which is exactly opposite to ours and trying random things (frameworks, just any random paper published).

Each row of my dataset is an individual post. Some users have up to 500 posts, some have as low as 10. If I concatenate the posts together based on user, the assigned label is accurate but the text sequence length is far too big (average 5k words after cleaning and removing a lot of words).

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

**EDIT: PLEASE DON'T POST THEIR PERSONAL INFO HERE**

I added a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gfnax4/im_sick_of_ai_influencers_especially_ones_that/fpvvxsk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) answering some of the recurring questions.

**TL;DR -** I'm not salty because I'm jealous. I don't think I'm salty because they're a woman, and I'm definitely not trying to gatekeep. I want more people to learn ML and Data Science, I just don't want them to learn snake oil selling. I'm particularly salty because being a snake oil salesman and a shameless self-promoter seems to be a legitimate path to success. As an academic and a scientist, it bothers me that people listen to advice from such snake oil salesmen.",,812,datascience

5973,fzweaf,My Giant Data Quality Checklist,,"First - [I also published this on Medium if you'd prefer to read the full article there](https://medium.com/@TWB_BI/starting-a-data-quality-checklist-2d500e97ab5c),

Here's the list without all the intro BS. Please do comment if you have some items to add! :

# Chapter 1 : General Structure

* Is there an established map of the database?
* Is it visible to all users?
* Is there a public strategy of how it is tested for truth?
* Are there known party(ies) responsible for updating it when there are structural changes?
* How often is it updated?
* When is the next scheduled update?
* Is there a change log to track prior changes?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with questions?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with general conversational topics?
* The user list from a DBA is great for this.
* Consider having a monthly meeting and yearly summit per database. Remember, this is YOUR responsibility. Not the owner of the database.
* If the source of data is an application or form, is there a map from every entry field to the corresponding field in the database?
* Capacity / Uptime
* How concerned should you be with locking up the database with poorly written queries?
* Who do you go to when it is dead?
* Is the data backed up / archived anywhere?
* For how long?
* Do you remove old values from the production database after archiving?
* Are queries logged?
* How often is the database refreshed, if it is part of an ETL?
* Automatically check, at the appropriate time, if it has been updated. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably not updated.
* What is the official way to request access to the database?
* Is there a time-out process of old user ID‚Äôs?
* Have a plan in place for when an automated procedure‚Äôs stored credentials are suddenly invalid.

**Tables**

* Is there any rhyme or reason to the naming of tables?
* If there are very similar tables (ie. CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER\_NEW, CUSTOMER\_NEW\_NEW), do the alternates need to exist?
* Is this table ‚Äúone row that is constantly kept updated‚Äù or ‚Äúone row for each time the data changes‚Äù?

**Joins**

* Should there be at least one ‚ÄúChild‚Äù for every ‚ÄúParent‚Äù?
* Is there a maximum expected ‚ÄúChildren‚Äù for every ‚ÄúParent‚Äù?
* Should there be ‚ÄúChildren‚Äù who don‚Äôt have ‚ÄúParents‚Äù?
* Is every table relatable to every other table?
* On joining fields
* Do the field types match, or do you need to do a conversion?
* Queries / Processes
* Is the query properly notated?
* With the code removed, the notes should be copy and paste-able to a non-technical business partner.
* The notes should represent reality. Please.
* Is it possible to do an ‚Äúanti-query‚Äù?
* Reverse your filters, but mirror your production process. In high value pipelines, this can be a huge preventative measure for errors, and an easy way to provide ‚Äúfree‚Äù extra value.
* Is it possible to do the query by hand on a small subset of records?
* If so, do this periodically. Seriously. I know you got into this line of business to not do this stuff manually, but doing this periodically can help verify all systems are working properly.
* Is the process entirely automated?
* If not, don‚Äôt launch.
* This includes any of the tests below that say ‚Äúperiodically‚Äù, if possible.
* Is it possible to store the results of every query, along with a timestamp of run (especially as part of an ETL process?)
* Are you choosing a ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù approach, or a ‚Äúblacklist‚Äù approach?
* If there are changes after launch ‚Äî will you be applying those changes to previous projects, or leaving them in place with old (and potentially inaccurate) data?

# Chapter 2 : Data Types

**All / General**

* Are null values allowed?
* Are the fields expected to change over time? If the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù, take hashes of lines at the time of development and test periodically to see if they change. If the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, take extracts with timestamps in the name and only use those (instead of production) for reproducibility.
* Expert level ‚Äî Create a X / Y grid of every field against every other field. Have all parties involved in development (especially the humans that are the source of the data) write assumptions and rules that come up in each cell (if this field is ‚Äúbeer‚Äù this other field should be ‚Äú$5.99‚Äù) Document all of these. If something looks wrong and the customer says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ok‚Äù, DOCUMENT THIS. With audio evidence if possible. Video isn‚Äôt bad either.

**General Text (Free entry)**

* If there is a default size, why is the default size set to the size it is?
* Is the field having an identity crisis ‚Äî does it only contain integers, dates, locations, etc.? If so ‚Äî should it be converted to the correct type? What do you do with those that can‚Äôt be converted?
* Does the text contain invisible characters that will cause it to print strangely (line-break)?
* Does the text contain special (or international) characters? Should it? If you are planning on exporting to .csv downstream, are you removing commas upstream (or tabs, or pipes, etc.).
* Is there a list of ‚Äústop words‚Äù that should be applied? Especially inappropriate words. Don‚Äôt let an f-bomb get into a shareholder report.

**Categorical Text (Unique list of values)**

* Store the unique values at the time you are developing, and the counts of each value. Periodically test for new/missing values. Have a plan in place for when this inevitably happens.
* Periodically test for wild changes in distribution. Communicate these to anyone who will listen. This will make you a hero. Provide this list to stakeholders during development. This is always interesting, because often it is vastly different than their estimate.
* If there are multiple categorical fields, is there an hierarchy that is documented and should be followed (if veh\_type is ‚Äúcar‚Äù, then veh\_brand can only be ‚Äúaudi‚Äù, ‚Äúford‚Äù, ‚Äútoyota‚Äù etc.). Have a plan in place for when this inevitably breaks.
* Is the field indexed for fast grouping?
* If the values are text numbers (one, two, three) ‚Äî should they be converted to integers (1, 2, 3)?

**Boolean (True/False)**

* If these represent a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù in the process, should the downstream impact also be represented in data? (if override\_price=0 then discount\_price should never be null)
* Store the distribution at the time of developing, and periodically test for changes. Communicate these to anyone who will listen.
* Does True or False have a different name to you customers? IE, 0 = No Sale, 1 = Sale.
* What should you do with nulls, if there are any?

**ID (Keys, AutoNum)**

* Is the ID an AutoNum? If so, are there missing values?
* Is the ID a complex key? Do characters in the complex key relate to the data in any way? Periodically test that this remains true.
* Are duplicates allowed?
* Are you operating under the assumption that the ID for any given record will never change (maintaining an extract or join to a private table)? Have a plan in place for when they inevitably do.
* If you remove the ID from the equation, are there any two completely identical rows?

**General Number/Integer**

* Does null = 0?
* Are negative values expected?
* Are decimals expected? If not, is there rounding occurring upstream? What are the rounding rules?
* Is there a maximum/minimum expected value? Record the minimum and maximum value at the time of development. Periodically test to see if this record has been broken.
* Is there an expected distribution? Periodically test to see if this has changed.
* Is the number secretly categorical (only certain allowed values)?
* Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250‚Ä¶)?
* Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?
* Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I‚Äôm looking at you, Smallint)?
* Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price\*tax=total)?
* Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?

**Currency**

* Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?
* If the record also has a ‚Äúcountry‚Äù ‚Äî does the currency match the country?
* Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.
* Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.
* Does null = 0?
* Does the value represent a ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù value, or a ‚Äúpoint in time‚Äù value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?
* Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?

**General Contact Information**

* Is there a schedule for updating contact information?
* When was the information last updated?
* When was the information last successfully used?
* If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.
* Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?
* Does any contact information match your own company/office information?
* Does any customer‚Äôs information match that of a current or former employee?
* Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!

**Phone Numbers**

* Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?
* Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.
* Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?
* Is there an assumed area code?
* Is the area code a toll free area code?
* Is the area code a legitimate area code?
* Is the phone number stored as text?
* Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?
* Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?
* Are you removing ‚Äúbogus‚Äù phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).
* If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?

**Mailing Address**

* Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?
* Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?
* If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?
* Is the Postal Code -> State/Region -> Country strictly enforced?
* Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?
* Is there an additional ‚ÄúAPT‚Äù or ‚ÄúPO BOX‚Äù field? Should you be aware of this?
* If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?

**Sensitive PII**

* Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?
* Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?

**Financial Information**

* God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.
* Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?
* See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.

**Date / Time**

* Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?
* Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?
* Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.
* Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.
* Are there records outside business hours?
* Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?
* Are there any dates that are in the future?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?
* When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently ‚Äî it‚Äôs valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.
* If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).
* Does everyone know what ‚Äúbiweekly‚Äù means?
* Does everyone know what ‚Äúmidnight‚Äù means?
* Is there a business preferred date format?
* For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.
* Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?

5991,gv3i57,"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.",,"&#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",,665,datascience

5995,713hnw,How I went from no coding or machine learning experience to data scientist job offer in 20 months. [x-post r/learnprogramming],,"TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn‚Äôt have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor‚Äôs in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master‚Äôs in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don‚Äôt be afraid to switch jobs when you‚Äôre bored or it‚Äôs not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they‚Äôre not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn‚Äôt really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it‚Äôs always good to mention how much data you‚Äôve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don‚Äôt necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT‚Äôs Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx‚Äôs Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn‚Äôt apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you‚Äôre leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it‚Äôs where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won‚Äôt be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan‚Äôs Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn‚Äôt too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla‚Äôs Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It‚Äôs how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It‚Äôs also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn‚Äôt much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford‚Äôs Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng‚Äôs Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it‚Äôs nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don‚Äôt care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they‚Äôd like to see my what I do on the side. I‚Äôve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I‚Äôm going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn‚Äôt have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you‚Äôve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that‚Äôs where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest‚Ä¶eh. Doesn‚Äôt really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- ‚Äújunior data scientist‚Äù, ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù, ‚Äúsenior analytics‚Äù, ‚Äúsenior data analyst‚Äù, ‚Äújunior machine learning‚Äù, ‚Äúentry data science‚Äù, and so on. When you‚Äôre on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can‚Äôt sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you‚Äôre willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I‚Äôve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn‚Äôt require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


‚Ä¢	What tools I used at work 


‚Ä¢	How have I made processes more efficient at work


‚Ä¢	Anything I‚Äôve automated 


‚Ä¢	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


‚Ä¢	Why the shift from the current job


‚Ä¢	How much I know about their company and how I‚Äôd describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I‚Äôve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn‚Äôt know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn‚Äôt feel complete. I couldn‚Äôt afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn‚Äôt vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I‚Äôll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code ‚Äúworked‚Äù, there was likely some test cases I didn‚Äôt account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn‚Äôt follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you‚Äôll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you‚Äôve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You‚Äôll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn‚Äôt made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn‚Äôt prepare for questions they‚Äôd ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I‚Äôd ask them. This did two things: I didn‚Äôt obsess about what they‚Äôd ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they‚Äôd ask questions about how I‚Äôd solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that‚Äôs exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it‚Äôs a way of thinking you‚Äôd have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you‚Äôll know what you did inside out, so it‚Äôs easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don‚Äôt have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn‚Äôt want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it‚Äôs what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How‚Äôs your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I‚Äôd explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they‚Äôd remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What‚Äôs something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they‚Äôre working on, what‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôd be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I‚Äôm excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn‚Äôt exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that‚Äôs not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I‚Äôd like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn‚Äôt purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


‚Ä¢	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with ‚ÄúNothing? Not even selling lemonade?‚Äù. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won‚Äôt be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I‚Äôm paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I‚Äôd be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I‚Äôm all for that. I‚Äôm coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the ‚Äúfinding meaning‚Äù part.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn‚Äôt contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn‚Äôt what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn‚Äôt get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven‚Äôt experienced it before so I‚Äôd have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I‚Äôm very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn‚Äôt ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it‚Äôs taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn‚Äôt know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain‚Äôs gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven‚Äôt done it in practice. Couldn‚Äôt answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng‚Äôs deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I‚Äôve described here- that I felt useless after my master‚Äôs, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


‚Ä¢	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


‚Ä¢	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I‚Äôd like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.‚Äù


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn‚Äôt want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like ‚Äúpeace!‚Äù


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It‚Äôs hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don‚Äôt take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don‚Äôt let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I‚Äôll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I‚Äôm not a fan of this explanation but I‚Äôve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don‚Äôt offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, you‚Äôll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they‚Äôll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you‚Äôve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I‚Äôll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that‚Äôs a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don‚Äôt have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It‚Äôs almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won‚Äôt stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn‚Äôt tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they‚Äôre in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you‚Äôre gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You‚Äôll stumble through a lot of material- and that‚Äôs okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You‚Äôll reach the ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment when everything clicks and you ‚Äúget it‚Äù. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it‚Äôs hard to know where to start and where to go. I‚Äôll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you‚Äôre lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn‚Äôt counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You‚Äôll burn out sometimes, and that‚Äôs okay! If you‚Äôre as driven and passionate as I was, you‚Äôll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps.

5996,cp51po,Landed my first full time job as a data scientist!!!,,"Didn't have anyone else to share with other than family but they don't really understand other than that I got a job.

Many hours invested into my thesis, independent learning, and portfolio finally paid off.",,624,datascience
5997,edgai0,Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",,622,datascience

6001,gf9hrs,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.",,617,datascience
6002,h96nz8,Keep a Brag Document,,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think ‚ÄúWhere did all that time go?‚Äù

Even worse, if YOU can‚Äôt remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They‚Äôll notice all the hard work you‚Äôre putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you‚Äôve written.

But we don‚Äôt live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan‚Äôs blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you‚Äôve achieved.

And these ‚Äúwins‚Äù don‚Äôt need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That‚Äôs definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don‚Äôt want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn‚Äôt actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let‚Äôs say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There‚Äôs a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you‚Äôre just stuck somewhere you don‚Äôt want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You‚Äôll often find that they‚Äôre able to mention things you completely forgot or didn‚Äôt even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other‚Äôs wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you‚Äôre basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you‚Äôre good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You‚Äôll both be able to identify areas in which you‚Äôre doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that‚Äôs helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think ‚ÄúWait..what was the point again?‚Äù

By using your brag document to set goals, you‚Äôll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you‚Äôll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

Any advice?,,"I did my BSc in 2017, worked as a SQL analyst for 5 months and I completed my Data Science MSc end of last year. For a entry level analyst role I have the skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python, I even did a tableau course on Analysis/ Data Science.  One of my concern is my in depth knowledge on the tools and programs above as I have no idea how to compare myself to another analyst.

I have a speech impediment which as expected gets worse during interviews as I have to think on my feet really quickly. I feel like I struggle with the competency-based questions, because due to my stammer I cannot use the STAR method correctly. Most of my feedback from the interviews were I wasn't the right candidate and other had fit the bill etc etc. ""you weren't confident, and they felt I wasn't strong enough"". I have never doubted myself nor have I lost confidence.

Especially during the lock-down, it‚Äôs hard for me to get an interview as most companies are closed and those that are still hiring start from a telephone call. In terms of landing an interview I have refined my CV with professional help and most interview reaches the face-to-face stage.

I am really afraid that I will slowly lose all my knowledge and programming and analytical skills which will cause me to lose an interview in the future. My goal is to be a Data Science in the future but I cannot even land a entry level Data Analyst position.

Would appreciate if you guys can answer these questions.

* What skills do I need to polish?
* Are there any alternative ways to answer the competency-based questions?

6015,d9a3o1,The Secret sauce to landing a data science role,,"I see tons of posts on here claiming specific technical skills needed to become a data scientist. As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for, especially if you've made it to a conversational interview. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning or are you obviously chasing titles, prestige, or salary?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and an open-mind are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for. 

Hope my advice helps. Good luck!",,538,datascience

6033,ckdnkf,Recruiting (Still) Ain‚Äôt Easy: Job Hunting as a Senior Data Scientist,,"There are a whole lot of resources out there discussing how to get your first job in data science, but relatively few about getting that second, third, and fourth job once you‚Äôve finally broken in and paid your dues. To that end, I thought I‚Äôd share some statistics and commentary about my most recent job search.

Background: Based out of New York. MS in Statistics, 4+ years in data science proper at 2 different companies, a few years in related quant roles before that.

Current company: a fairly large org in a traditional industry, currently trying to rebrand itself as a tech company, with mixed results so far. Despite our best efforts, data science hasn‚Äôt really found its place yet, and probably never will. That was the main reason for my job search.

&#x200B;

The Numbers:

131: companies I applied to, using a mix of online apps, recruiters, and referrals/networking

77: initial callbacks

7: companies I applied to twice and got an interview on the second try

25: take home assignments or HackerRank challenges I was asked to complete

8: take homes I actually did

9: whiteboard or coderpad sessions

5: whiteboard sessions I totally fucked up

18: onsites I was invited to

12: onsites I actually went to

4: times I was ghosted after a final round onsite

42: hours I spent onsite

3: offers I ended up getting

5: months it took from initial round of apps to finally accepting an offer

100: the lowest base salary I was quoted (in thousands)

195: the highest base salary I was quoted

160: the median base salary

&#x200B;

The Aftermath:

Yes, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get interviews and callbacks when you‚Äôve already got a data science job. That‚Äôs the good news. I don‚Äôt even consider myself a great data scientist, I‚Äôm probably 70th percentile at best. My GitHub is empty except for 1 side project I did 3 years ago. I don‚Äôt write cover letters. My professional network consists of lawyers and vagabonds. Turns out that‚Äôs enough! I turned down quite a number of interview requests and next steps. These were the most common reasons:

\-low pay

\-job was essentially product analytics

\-job was essentially software engineering

\-product or industry didn‚Äôt interest me

\-team was already quite mature, which makes it less exciting for me

The bad news is that it still takes a while to successfully secure an offer at a company that you actually want to work for. The challenge when you are an experienced candidate is no longer applying to jobs and hoping for a response. The challenge is carving out time (when you already have a day job) to conduct interviews and do take homes, and then hoping that you‚Äôre getting good vibes from the manager, the team, and the org at large. You now have the luxury of being picky about where you spend your time.

There are loads of companies who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing when it comes to data science or ML, and only a handful that do, while also having an interesting product/challenges and good comp. Everyone knows who those companies are, so everyone who‚Äôs good applies to them, and so the competition is still pretty fierce at the highest levels.

Startups vs Enterprise:

There was an interesting split in terms of callbacks by company size and type. I received a grand total of 1 callback from an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù company. The vast majority of my callbacks were from small-to-mid size companies that could colloquially be described as a ‚Äútech startup‚Äù or ‚Äútech-adjacent‚Äù, or through corporate recruiters who made first contact. After a while I stopped even applying to banks, media, insurance companies and any place that used legacy ATS software like Taleo or BrassRing (truly, the black hole of resumes). If they used Lever, Greenhouse or Jobvite instead, then I was golden. It‚Äôs funny to think that the course of your career could be so irrevocably shaped by shitty job posting software, but there you go.

Take Homes:

I don‚Äôt think anyone I know actively enjoys doing these but they‚Äôre apparently the new normal now so you gotta deal with them. The first few I did yielded poor results but over time I hit a nice groove. The key is to comment and explain everything you did (assumptions, reasoning, logic, commentary). My most successful take homes contained roughly the same amount of documentation as actual code.  I used the simplest methods I could because I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time on these things, but I made sure to include a mini-report.

Something I Learned:

I eventually realized that the ideal interview process for me would frontload all the technical screening and reserve the onsite for conceptual or high level discussions.  Assign whatever coding screen, stats Q&A or homework you need before bringing someone in.  Ensure that everyone who makes it to your final round has already demonstrated sufficient technical chops.  There's nothing worse for a candidate than carving out a 4 hour chunk of time away from work, then showing up to someone's office just to flunk a whiteboard code sesh at the very top of the morning...and then having to interview for another 3 hours.  All it takes is one mistake and it could torpedo your chances.

Networking (bonus edit):

The thing with networking is that it works really well when it happens.  It's how I got one of my previous jobs: pretty much walked in for coffee and walked out with an offer.  Unfortunately, it's not a magic button you can just press when you need it.  There are a finite supply of senior DS jobs out there,, so you can't rely on it every time you need a change of scenery.  Definitely would recommend meeting people, getting your name out there, etc, but realize that it's more of a long term play than anything else.

Most Embarrassing/Annoying Moments (another bonus edit):

\-forgot how to write a window function

\-interviewer didn't believe common table expressions were valid SQL.  They totally are.

\-couldn't solve a string compression problem quickly/efficiently enough

\-blanked out on a binary search tree problem

\-couldn't quite explain how L1 regularization induces sparsity

\-""What is your greatest weakness?""  Seriously?

\-ghosted by the same company twice.  Fool me once...",,492,datascience

I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",,483,datascience

""Under no circumstances should someone claim credit for someone else's work. I was involved in litigation against Google for something similar over 10 years ago.

[https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/2:2004cv09484/167815/776](https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/2:2004cv09484/167815/776)

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day. Once again, my apologies for my failed try at providing you time-saving value and exposure. Site is down, time-saving, content aggregating, author visibility-enhancing site is no longer available.

Maybe you will enjoy these guys news aggregation: [https://news.google.com/search?q=Artificial%20Intelligence&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen](https://news.google.com/search?q=Artificial%20Intelligence&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)""",,420,datascience
6060,ee7xuq,Beware of taking advice from people coming from a fundamentally different background,,"There are several topics on this sub that are highly... partisan for lack of a better word.

What degree to pursue, PhD or not, Python vs. R, etc.

While different people will naturally have different opinions on the subject, I think it's particularly important to recognize that a person's path and past success will heavily bias their opinion.

Successful artists will tell up and coming ones to ""follow their dream"". But the reality is that a more personalized advice should probably be ""follow your dream if you're extremely talented, unique and have the family support to prevent you from ending up homeless"".

I think the same is true of this sub. Not everyone here has the inherent ability to become a Principal Scientist at Google, nor to become the Chief Data Officer for a Fortune 59 company. 
EDIT: I should have said ""not everyone has the right combination of inherent ability, work ethic, and/or life circumstances to become a (...). Inherent ability is one component, but the reality is that there are many reasons why a person may not get there - and not all of them are tied to ability.
Most importantly, not everyone's quality of life will be maximized by pursuing that life.

When you read advice on this sub, always keep a critical eye for how it applies to you, your inherent strengths and weaknesses, your current situation and your future opportunities.

Garth Brooks probably wouldn't take advice from Carrie Underwood. And if you are anything other that a generational talent of a guitar player, you should probably take any advice you get from Steve Vai with a gigantic grain of salt. 

If you're a world leading expert in computer vision, you don't need to take advice from people like me who have worked up the ladder in traditional functions. But if you're someone who doesn't have (and won't have the opportunity to get) a PhD in computer vision from a leading university in the world, then be very weary of taking advice from someone who does at face value - at least without being very aware of how to adapt it to your situation.",,415,datascience

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!",,400,datascience

6068,gwibmc,My thoughts on the data science job hunt during COVID-19,,"Some background: I have 6 years of DS experience, 2 masters degrees, and spent a few years as a data analyst as well. Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

&#x200B;

""Guideline for recruitment processes in DS roles""

Can't change it now but based on the comments I think it helped a decent amount of people which is all I wanted to do


.



After a month long process I GOT THE JOB!!! Found out about an hour ago, junior data scientist in the South florida area, 80k a year (100k with performance bonuses plus benefits). 


For anyone who wants advice or to familiarize themselves with how the process was:


Step 1) saw ad on linked in, sent my CV 


Step 2) Email with a take home project, they have us a 1 GB database and we had to make a predictive model for a churn rate after 2 years. Basically we had 5 linked dataframes one with customer information (2 million observations) and then 4 other data sets with 5-15 millions observations. Had to reduce it to one data frame. As in add a variable from the other data sets to the customer one based on customer ID i.e create stuff like age variable, account balance, number of services hired, credit score at the time they applied (trickiest one), and contract duration from the 4 other data sets.


Final DF was 1.5 million then had to filter by desired population, with all the filters the DF was only 35k observations and that's what I ran my models on.


It took about 6 hours but I googled A LOT of stuff #stackoverflow. I could've used mysql for the first part but they asked for the whole script in R or Python (I used R). I kept it simple did a Logit, a random forest and a SVM. Error rate with cross validation was about 15%, svm was the best model, baseline was 30%. Asked to make a ppt.




Step 3)  Phone interview asking about my degree and internship experience, 15 minutes told me at the end they want me to come to a face to face



Step 4) face to face interview, 30 minutes with the heads of the team I'd be in, asked why I like the industry, why this firm, where i see myself down the line, about potentially leaving, in depth questions about my undergrad degree and what I did in my internships. Afterwards they took a 15 questions multiple choice math test, (it was like the generic sat/gre math part). 



Step 5) interview with regional manager 30 minutes, more personal questions, talked a lot about the company and my role, what where my expectations, benefits, etc. At the end he took a 3 question test, one was what the angle of a triangle at 3:15 in a wall clock is, the second was why are manholes round, and another was how many cars do I think were sold in the U.S in 2019. 


Step 6) confirmation call!


My degree was a bs in economics with a specialization in econometrics and a minor in stats! Top 40 school ranked nationally. Hope this helps anyone applying!


.

Edit: Well apparently this is considered a very rigorous process and I agree, I have other friends who got similar jobs with easier processes. However it's my first job right out of college (december grad) and I only had 1 year experience. Also with bonuses I can expect to make about 100k so I think it's fair. Plus now you know if you can do steps 1-5 you're guaranteed to get a job even in the hardest of recruitment processes!",,388,datascience

There is also a sharp divide between ""product owners"" and worker bees who execute someone else's vision, so all my time is accounted for. No room to scope/source new projects at all.

What I love about analytics/data science and where my true value lies is defining problems and creatively working with stakeholders to solve them.

Does anyone have any recommendations about industries/companies/job titles to explore that give data scientists the scope to come up with new projects and where there isn't a strong product owner/technical divide?

Edit: Wow data people. Thanks for the responses! Been really interesting to read the diverging opinions and advice. My takeaway is that there can be a time and a place for these tools and perhaps the explanatory variable is management and company culture. Personally, I will try to be the change in my org that makes these processes work better. Thanks for enlightening me and breaking me out of my mental local minimum.",,385,datascience
6075,gsn5lz,Well today was a depressing day for data science at work. What can I do better?,,"I work as an Analytics Manager and normally I don't really share with my colleagues the in depth details of my work because nobody is technical. They just know I use SQL and Python to spit out a report and that's all they really understand.

Recently I had an opportunity to do something interesting where I had a very skewed data set and was asked to make sense of it. I thought applying a log transformation to normalize the data as the distribution was extremely skewed and thought it would make the data easier to interpret and I was happy with the results.

My colleagues wanted to know how I arrived at my conclusion for my recommendation so I walked them through the process. I provided a high level overview, but they really wanted to get into the nitty gritty of exactly HOW I got to where I got. Again, I normally don't like to do this because they tend ask very detailed questions like ""Can you explain exactly how this works so I can understand?"" and it gets tough to explain certain things (e.g., I would say something like ""I got this raw data from the API"" but then it's followed up by a question like ""What is an API and why didn't you just use the vendor's dashboard? Why doesn't the vendor's interface provide the data? Why do you have to go through this step?"").

Well anyway I was explaining my logic and really tip toed around the stats by really trying to say essentially that I applied some logic that would more even distribute the data. I stupidly said the word ""log"" and it was over. Their faces froze for a good 10 seconds before someone spoke.

""I'm sorry..but what? What is log? Why do you need this log? I'm really confused. How am I suppose to explain this to the SVP? Can you just change it so you're indexing off the median or mean? This doesn't make any sense.""

I'm dead.

So guys, how do you avoid getting away with having to explain things by  not using technical jargon? I mean like I said, I normally just show people the output of my report and I don't get too many in depth questions about it, but when people really pry, it gets tough. I don't know how to avoid saying ""I ran a regression model"" because it freaks people out and they get upset because they don't understand it and want me to do something that is easier to interpret. It's already frustrating that they think I'm over complicating things by using Python instead of Excel, but I can at least tell them certain things like Excel can't handle 1+ million rows and they can understand that.

EDIT: Hey all, appreciate all you feedback, both positive and negative. I think it's all constructive. There's a lot of replies in this thread so it's hard to answer everyone's questions. Some of you ask the same things and I do answer them, but you might have to dig through the comments to find it. In any case, let me post some frequently asked ones:

1) Did you use graphs and visuals?

Answer: I did. I actually stayed away from using the word log at first and just showed them a histogram of what the data looked like before the log transform and then after the log transform. What followed up was ""How did you do this? What did you use to index the numbers?"" And that's when I mentioned I used a log transformation.

2) How did you explain what a log transform was?

Answer: I didn't directly explain it in math terms. I described it in the form of an analogy or comparable example. This is what I said: 

""Imagine we were looking at salaries for a company. Most people for example will make a salary between something like $40 - 100k right? Well what if the top execs in the company make like $10 million dollars. Now imagine you tried to index using the mean? Wouldn't the mean say the average employee at this company makes a salary of $1 million dollars or something? That's not right. Basically, a log transformation would keep everyone's differences in consideration, but minimize the importance of some of those execs who are not entirely representative of the rest of the company. That way you can better see the difference in salary among every worker and not have your vision obscured by some of these execs who are throwing off that balance. ""

Unfortunately, this proved to be even more confusing and my colleagues really zoned in on exactly what a log was and how it's calculated and it was tough to navigate from there.

3) What is SVP?

Answer: It stands for Senior Vice President. It basically is a reference to our execs.",,387,datascience

6087,gh3v0q,Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions.

TLDR; I spent a couple hours everyday for 2 years learning and doing analysis for fun, and found opportunities for data science in every aspect of my job until I had enough experience for someone to take a chance on me and hire me

My starting point:

Degree- BBA from a top 50 school in Information Systems and Data Analytics

Relevant Coursework- Intro to Statistics, Database Design, Intro to SQL, Applied Business Intelligence Tools (Alteryx, Qlik, Tableau), Intro to Data Visualization, Intro to Machine Learning in SAS, Web Application Development (Javascript/HTML), Intro to Mobile App Development (Swift)

With these skills I was able to land a job as an analyst at a global consulting firm (i.e. Accenture/CapGemini, EY)

**Below is a roadmap of my first 2 years at my first job**:

First project on the job:
- Gathering requirements for a BI application
- Here I spent 4 hours everyday 7 days a week taking courses on Data Camp and reading books like Python for Dummies. I it took about 8 months to replace all of my excel work with Python and really learn enough to be useful on a team of business folks. 

With the skills from my first role I got a new project doing data cleansing, data munging, quality checks etc. using my existing SQL skills and new skills in Python. I was asked to do all this work in excel, but forced myself to do everything in Python both to learn and prove myself worthy of harder tasks.

I took opportunities to do simple statistical testing in Python and when I saw opportunities to bolster my team's analysis by looking at things such as feature importance from a tree based model or setting up data correctly for a simple linear regression, **I forced that work into our project by doing it on my own time and presenting it to my team**.  

Slowly I became my team's go to general analytics and Python automation person. I used this internal reputation to get a new project on a team looking to implement some basic ML models at a client and needed someone who knew sklearn and could guide client analysts in doing things like walk-forward validation for time series models, and pointing out issues such as data leakage. 

On my own time I started to read books like ""Forecasting, Principles and Practice"" by Rob Hydnman and find dummy datasets on Kaggle to test concepts on. I took things a step further by creating dashboards of analysis I did for fun and putting together a small Tableau/Github portfolio, and adding a Personal Projects section to my resume. The portfolio work I kept private and would link it either in cold emails to hiring managers, or keep it handy in case I discussed a pet project during an interview. 

**Finding a new job**

Job titles I was searching for- Data Analyst, Associate Data Scientist

Number of cold applications over 3 months- ~60

Number of first round phone interviews- 7

Number of final rounds- 3

Job offers- 2

Almost every interview process followed this format:
- Phone screen with recruiter to discuss background
- Take home technical exam, either SQL or Python, just general analysis
- Phone call with hiring manager
- On site technical + meeting with hiring manager and team 

My pitch was that I was able to tie business problems to data science solutions, and could not only execute on problems as a data scientist using my technical skills but also present the results to the business and executives. I think this combination of soft and hard skills was the reason anyone even bothered to talk to me given my background.

I think what got me the final offers was how I presented myself as willing to learn, giving evidence in the form of my pet projects, all of the books I've read and courses I took in my free time. After I received the offer, the head of the R&D group (a math PHD) said he liked my hustle and thought he could just teach me what I didn't know or point me to the right learning resources. 

For those of you looking to break in, I definitely think even if you're not someone with the perfect background, with enough time and study you can do it. 

With that being said, my next step as I move into this role will be applying to masters programs to shore up all of my quantitative deficiencies. I think if I want to thrive in this role and move up I'll need the quantitative foundation.

I think you can teach yourself enough to get that first job, but more than that and you'll need to be exceptional at teaching yourself a lot of things! Unfortunately I learn much better in a class setting with homework assignments and structured learning!

Ask me anything :)

There are also other non-data science-related books that I've still found to be helpful on the job, so I've come here to ask you great people what books you've used to hone your craft.  Can be data-science, business, social, programming, etc. related.

* Is there a book that helped with a deeper knowledge of your domain? Post it! 

* Is there a book designed for business professionals that helped you give better presentations to customers? Post it!

* Do you think *How to win friends and influence people* is a must read for every human being? Say so!

I'll start:

* I work in NLP so [Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262133601/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) gave me a deeper understanding of my domain.

* [Uncle Bob's Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=uncle+bob%27s+clean+coder&qid=1565127081&s=books&sr=1-1) made me a better programmer and helped me write cleaner code in productionized models.

* [The git pocket guide](https://www.amazon.com/Git-Pocket-Guide-Working-Introduction/dp/1449325866/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CQ6FIQKJ0SM4&keywords=git+pocket+reference&qid=1565127135&s=books&sprefix=git+pocket%2Cstripbooks%2C197&sr=1-1) and [Learning the bash shell](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-bash-Shell-Programming-Nutshell/dp/0596009658/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bash+o+reilly&qid=1565127157&s=books&sr=1-1) . I came into my current position with pretty strong java and python skill but was very unskilled with git and bash, which I now use daily.  I've learned some neat git tricks and gaining more understanding of linux commands and bash scripts has helped me automate scripts that would have been a pain to do in python.

Compare it to /r/machinelearning where there is proper professional discussions (even though some of the content is academic in nature).

I'd much rather there be 3 interesting threads per week than 20 garbage low-effort threads in a week.

Half of the frontpage is just generic career advice and the other half is /r/askreddit styled ""what do you think of X"" questions where nothing of value ever comes up. It's fine if there is 2-3 less serious threads per week but jesus christ THEY'RE ALL GARBAGE.

6110,hbxj93,Forever a fraud ? Keep having horrific interviews and feel like I can never become a Data Scientist,,"I have had some experience working as a machine learning engineer but if I am honest with myself, I barely did much. I am 24 with 2 years of experience. Got laid off, rightfully so.

I have been struggling with myself and I keep on preparing, studying... But the result is a loop of painful rejections. You know, the kind of rejections where the company was interested in you, set the bar reasonably not high and expected me to pass through it

&#x200B;

And yet I didn't. My profile looks good on paper but I feel like a fraud. Like someone who can try all he wants to but let's be honest, who is he kidding ? He doesn't know shit. He can't take up REAL responsibilities without having someone look over his shoulder. And even then he is lazy, mediocre.

Tried doing projects, watching videos, kaggle (that's a lie, I tried like 2 or 3 competitions that too I followed what others did)

I guess the gist of it is that I think I am a fraud. A phony. **I can have the bookish knowledge but I will forget it when I need it or would be unable to apply it.**

I'll never have what it takes to be an actual data scientist. It is just an unsophisticated fantasy.  And at the same I don't see myself doing anything else so I guess I am useless to the society\~ No one will hire me cause I can do nothing.

Just wanted to let it out after yet another disastrous interview which I knew everything about(as in, the answers to the questions), yet I messed it up. They threw a low ball and I missed my swing. Looked like a fool. & Now I am binging on the Office (TV show) to numb it up

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",,336,datascience
6111,bezjso,"Why arguing about who is a ""Real Data Scientist"" is a misguided exercise",,"One of the most common arguments these days revolves around what constitutes a ""real"" Data Scientist, and by proxy, who is deserving of the Data Scientist title. A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.

I think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.

There are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.

Other examples:

- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).

- Every person in national/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.

- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)

- Every quant/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.

The only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.

So why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:

1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.

2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: 

* Must have 2+ years experience with R/Python
* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL
* Must have experience building statistical models.
* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff

3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python/SQL/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python/SQL/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.

4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. 

5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role ""Analyst"" or ""Sr. Analyst"" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one ""Analyst"" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role ""Data Scientist"". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?

* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. ""Analyst"" may leave some of those people out. 

* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job ""Programming Friendly Analyst"", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. 

And there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.

More importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).

You will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the ""Analyst"" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as ""can do ML"", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.

And then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications/etc.

On to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel ""icky"" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.

**TL;DR: No one company/group of people get to dictate what is/isn't a ""Data Scientist"". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**",,341,datascience

But school gave me an overview of several topics. 

Data structures and algorithms class taught me the sorting algorithms, recursion, evolved recursion(dynamic programming), and the space-time trade off for various data structures...but I only had a few assignments to internalize the several concepts I was taught. 

Preparing for interviews and learning how to code these concepts taught me so much more. For one, I had to implement all of these from scratch and I practiced them much more than once or twice(unlike in school). I was also exposed to many more algorithms thanks to geeksforgeeks and the interview questions I had. 

My initial data science class taught me how to query from api‚Äôs, create visualizations, some linear/logistic regression and use Hadoop for a bigram word counts. 

But studying for interviews taught me these same concepts in much more depth and gave me much more muscle memory. 

Same with sql- my school never had a proper class on sql- we had one group project for a client where we dabbled in sql a little

It was only after practicing sqlzoo and hackerrank that I actually even truly understood sql. 

I look back and ask why. It‚Äôs simple- I learn better when answering quiz like questions on several topics over and over again and writing code for the same algorithms several times. School doesn‚Äôt give you that opportunity to fail your way to understanding the material.

I feel there's a discrepancy between (1) what people ***think*** makes them good candidates for data science / engineering roles vs. (2) what ***actually*** makes them good candidates for data science / engineering roles.

1. **What some people** ***think*** **makes them good candidates for data roles at a company:** master's degree in data science; Kaggle projects; worked through a reading list; taken online courses in data science.
2. **What** ***actually*** **makes people good candidates for data roles at a company:** collected and analysed data for fun; worked with data at a company before; worked with data in a research role in a university.

How do these differ, in practice? The second group of people know that data is messy; they're motivated to work with data; they've used real-world tools; they seem more ""interesting""; they have hard-won critical thinking and communication skills.  All of these things are important in data science.

Implications: If you want to break into the area of data science, and you don't have much experience, work on a real project that requires you to collect, analyse, and present real data. E.g. work as a research assistant; email professors to ask if there are research projects you can get involved with; contact people in small- to medium-sized companies asking if you can help them with real data problems they have. ***Get as much real-world experience as you can, as early as you can.***",,325,datascience

Edit2: It seems to me that everyone is interpreting  that because I'm complaining I'm also not a good, diligent worker. It's possible to realize that you're lucky and realize this is a great opportunity but also see how the environment can be less than ideal. The point of the post was to be more humorous than anything. I work very hard every day and stay late four out of five days a week. When I'm at home I watch videos and read about data science. Just because someone shares an experience that is negative doesn't mean that they don't appreciate or work hard at their job. In fact, both of my supervisors have praised my work in the short time I've been there. You shouldn't be so quick to judge, but again, this is the internet so I'm not sure what I expected. As for the coming in late part, that was just flair. Our company is New School so they let employees come in between 7 and 9 and leave early if they get their work done.",,325,datascience

6130,g8250o,How do I get out of data science?,,"Edit: Thanks for all the help and good ideas. I think I really just need more variety and (substantial) human interaction in my work. A couple mentioned they didn't have trouble going into systems engineers from data science, so I'll look into that. I work for a defense contractor that really focuses on IT implementations, and I think I want to get more into working with tangible products. So I don't know if I can quite do what I want without making a lateral move. I live right down the road from Raytheon and the ULA, so after all this blows over, I think I'll send my resume out. I'll also talk to my boss and see if I can shadow our company's product managers for a little while. I don't know a ton about that world but it does seem interesting. Thanks a ton! 

I've worked as a data scientist for a couple years now, and I'm really unhappy. I've worked at a start up and a large company. I'm well compensated but I've really grown to hate my career.

I'm tired of spending my days staring a computer. I'm tired of working for ""AI experts"" who couldn't import a Python module if their lives depended it. I'm tired of having to solve everyone's data problems and having my projects drag out for months. 

I've considered systems engineering and project management, but I don't feel like I have enough experience for that. 

What else can I do? I don't really want to go back to school because I hated college and honestly didn't do very well. Has anyone else made a transition out of data science?",,320,datascience
6131,ej5yux,I Self Published a Book on ‚ÄúData Science in Production‚Äù,,"Hi Reddit,

Over the past 6 months I've been working on a technical book focused on helping aspiring data scientists to get hands-on experience with cloud computing environments using the Python ecosystem. The book is targeted at readers already familiar with libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn that are looking to build out a portfolio of applied projects.

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry. 

Here's links to the book, with sample chapters and code listings:

6132,6q1y7b,Some advice for young and aspiring Data Scientists,,"I've decided to make this small post to help people navigate this big world of data science, feel free to ask any follow up questions, and please do not PM me, any questions you have, ask them here, for everyone to see.

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data.",,322,datascience

6134,a5v1ba,Data science questions I never knew to ask until I started working (and still dont know the answers to),,"Here are some questions I have that I never knew to ask until I started working as a DS. I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there.

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting.",,318,datascience

6142,feopi4,I woefully underestimated the amount of SQL I need to write. Looking for intermediate-advanced tutorials.,,"Pretty much the title. I know some SQL, but I'm not very solid at it. I wrote my first self join with a CASE WHEN in the join condition today and felt pretty proud, but looking at some of my teammates, it's pretty obvious my SQL skill could use some improvement. As much as I love pandas, if I can do a fair amount of data-prep up front, I'd prefer that (and it keeps our DBAs employed).

One of my teammates took a SQL query that another department wrote and sped it up by an order of magnitude (45 minutes to about 4 minutes) by pulling data into four different temporary tables and joining on those. That's the sort of insight I'm looking to build.

Any recommendations on tutorials? I'm looking for some intermediate SQL resources, preferably geared toward teaching you *when* you'd want to use certain techniques.

6144,eleuz9,About IBMs Data Science Certification,,"Yesterday, there was a top post on this sub on 30day trial IBM gives for its [data science courses, specializations and certs](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average. Maybe they were good enough at the time they were made. This would be a terrible way for someone to enter data science world.",,312,datascience

6170,bvioch,[AI application] Let your machine play Super Mario Bros!,,,,288,datascience
6171,9krcbd,I kind of hate my job as a data scientist. Do you like your jobs? Any advice for me?,,"So, I supposedly work for the ""best place to work"" in my city due to a positive culture, pay, work/life balance, etc etc. But, the culture around data science is not very fun, maybe even toxic. The company dates back to the late 1800s-early 1900s and the average tenure is over 15 years so, it is so slow to change and largely run by, what I call, ""intestinal analytics."" I can't really afford to leave right now because I made the mistake of living at my means and I have plenty of debt to pay down before I can move, maybe a year and a half longer before I can afford a pay cut without dramatically decreasing my standard of living, which takes a bit of time to liquidate assets anyhow.

&#x200B;

They hired our entire team over the course of one year. We are a team of 12 and I am one of 6 Data Scientists. I was initially hired due to my abilities in R. I did some of the advanced modeling work for a while, which I enjoyed. After a few months, the higher ups decided to purchase tableau. I was the only one of the team with prior tableau experience so, I got moved over to tableau world. At first, that was fine because I had to refresh my memory and relearn a lot of things as well as train another team member. Now, it's tedious and boring. So, now, it's me and a coworker who live in tableau world. The bad part is less the boringness and more so the fact that we are responsible for facing the company and building something presentable out of the modeling work that others can understand.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the models show that the company is losing ground in comparison to competitors, which, for some reason, we get yelled at over, because ""the modeling can't be correct."" It is. They just don't like it. Keep in mind, the profit margin for this company is over 60% so, it's a bunch a spoiled old people who throw temper tantrums when they hear things they don't like. Another thing is that when we do roll out a very useful tool or valuable information, that's appreciated for about 15 seconds, then we get bombarded with requests to change colors to different colors based upon the person and no one is happy because they don't have their own individual view.

&#x200B;

The culture attitude towards my one coworker and I has also been on a steady decline since the company decided on a ""salary transparency policy"" about a month ago. During a reorg, I got a 25k increase, that I thought everyone else got. Apparently that isn't the case. Only my cowroker who also works primarily with Tableau did as well. Once that got out, she and I have faced a steady stream of judgement because we are making more money to do what is seen as easier. HR issued a statement saying that we got the increase due to the business facing nature and value tableau reports are adding to the company. Either way, it has been uncomfortable, especially when we need their help on something and since we are the youngest on the team.

&#x200B;

My coworker who works with me on tableau lives the next street over so we carpool a lot and she spends most of her commute home crying about how much she hates her job. I don't cry, but sometimes I really want to. We are both at the point where the money just isn't worth being totally miserable to 40 hours a week.

&#x200B;

I guess I just want to hear your experiences and, if you have any, advise on how to break out of this. Is this what the culture around data science is everywhere?",,288,datascience
6172,fpcltw,Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),,"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how. To throw this concept to the garbage can so that HR can have better leads on candidates feels a bit insulting.",,285,datascience
6173,ayapts,Fired from my first real data science job at 6 weeks.,,"I have been an analyst for several years, and recently moved into data science. Some of my roles have not always been terribly technical, because the employer was unwilling to provide tools. I have made do and practiced data science at home on my own time to improve or gain skills. 

I left my last job for what I thought was a long term data scientist role (government clearance!). It took 3 weeks to gain access to the data and once I finally did, it was incredibly messy and unstructured. I was told there will be significant and ample time for ramp up. I literally began building an NLP model yesterday and was looking to deploy it soon. 

I got the call from the staffing agency to not return to the facility due to lack of performance. They felt I made zero progress even though I was fleshing out issues and creating data science documentation for the team. Even when I asked, there were no clear details of what the organization was looking for. I had a path forward and expressed what I was working on to add value. If they wanted/needed something else, no one said a word. 

At 6 weeks, fired. Back to the drawing board again. I was told TODAY when I was being terminated they needed someone to lead the team and hit the ground running asap. When I interviewed with this company, none of these expectations were expressed otherwise I would have not taken the role. ",,286,datascience

> After Trump took office, DJ Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior removed from their websites the links to climate change data. The USDA removed the inspection reports of businesses accused of animal abuse by the government. The new acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, said he wanted to end public access to records of consumer complaints against financial institutions. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, statistics that detailed access to drinking water and electricity in Puerto Rico were deleted from the FEMA website. In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. ‚ÄúAmong the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders,‚Äù they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.

> 
> And as for the country‚Äôs first chief data scientist‚Äîwell, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. ‚ÄúI basically knew that these guys weren‚Äôt going to listen to us,‚Äù said DJ, ‚Äúso we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over.‚Äù He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù said DJ. ‚ÄúDistracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?‚Äù
> 

> The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. ‚ÄúIf you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic?‚Äù said DJ. ‚ÄúWhere are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we don‚Äôt have data, we‚Äôre screwed.‚Äù
> 

> His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, he‚Äôs never heard a peep about them. And he came to see there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the Trump administration‚Äôs attitude toward public data. Under each act of data suppression usually lay a narrow commercial motive: a gun lobbyist, a coal company, a poultry company. ‚ÄúThe NOAA webpage used to have a link to weather forecasts,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was highly, highly popular. I saw it had been buried. And I asked: Now, why would they bury that?‚Äù Then he realized: the man Trump nominated to run NOAA thought that people who wanted a weather forecast should have to pay him for it. There was a rift in American life that was now coursing through American government. It wasn‚Äôt between Democrats and Republicans. It was between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in it for the money.

6179,3m78k1,I hire data scientists - this is the stuff this forum doesn't discuss enough...:,,"Hi,

I put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. 
&nbsp;

I got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.
&nbsp;


I wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.
&nbsp;


Lets set some context first.
I work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.
&nbsp;


I think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.
&nbsp;


Here are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. 
&nbsp;



**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**
There is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called ""Finance"" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.
&nbsp;



When it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.
&nbsp;



What does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***
&nbsp;



Some work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.
&nbsp;



But - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is ""good enough"", and will save you a couple of hours.
&nbsp;



*What does this mean?*
You'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your ""just get it done"" hat - which will be more often than your ""Get it perfect"" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a ""Good enough"" mentality. And show it.....
&nbsp;



**2) Learn to deal with junk**
Real world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.
Examples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.
&nbsp;


That data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is ""Get It Done"" stuff. 
&nbsp;


Also - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.
&nbsp;


All of this is probably best described as ""Data Monkeying"" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. 
&nbsp;


*What does that mean?*
When i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the ""Data Science"" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...
&nbsp;


It's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.
&nbsp;


If I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.
&nbsp;


Some examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.
&nbsp;


Fastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.
&nbsp;


**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**
Your going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. 
&nbsp;


Some people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)
&nbsp;



*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*
**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. ""I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y"". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. ""A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..""
&nbsp;




**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.
Some people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. 
&nbsp;



You don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib/SAS-Graph/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - ""good enough"" - but that still needs practice.
&nbsp;



**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - ""What do you think the client will do with this"" or ""How will HR use this data to plan the company party?"". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.

Then next few months you are creating reports about your new amazing system.

I won't lie I do enjoy making sense of data and building complicated data structures, but I feel like most of us don't deserve the title. I have a decent offer abroad in DL, which I am considering, if that doesnt work out I am back to cold hallls of academia.

------------------------------------------------

Edit to answer the major questions being asked:

First of all thank you so much for the love! Really appreciate it.

My background - Stats undergrad from a rigorous school, no MS or PHD. Got a job as a business analyst, realized I could do more with my skills. 

After that, I hate to be a cliche but what got me the furthest was projects. Find reasons to get excited about the technology, build projects. Go to hackathons, build projects. Add stuff to your blog, github, etc. There are no MOOCs or blogposts that will get you the experience of actually trying to process and model real data with real data problems.

Once you do enough of these, you can start to talk data science with other professionals at a level of comfort that signals that you're not bullshitting just to get a job. 

One other piece of advice I have is to push yourself at your current role in the right direction. I realized that while my current job wasn't a data science role, there were non technical things I could do to help become a better data scientist eventually - things like getting really good at SQL queries, building visualizations and focusing on story telling around the data (even just in powerpoint format). 

Combining this with the more technical data science related stuff in my own time helped a lot - the business side of data science is underrated but often what employers are really looking for.

The last thing I wanted to share is that it was not easy, and interviewing is really hard. I was doing several personal projects, built a blog, participated in hackathons, participated in kaggle challenges, going to meetups, linkedin, etc. and I still bombed at the beginning. Doing these things got my foot in the door - I had the opportunity to interview for top companies such as Facebook but I tanked at the beginning. It was embarrassing and humbling - but do not give up! Take interviews whenever you get a chance just to practice those skills and eventually it will become more natural.

That's all for now, can add more based on interest! 



------------------------------------------------

Edit #2: Remembered one more thing. There are going to be haters on your journey. People will gatekeep, claim that you're not doing 'real data science', or say the market is overflooded with data scientist wannabes. There's probably some truth there, but I had to keep reminding myself that everyone starts somewhere, and in the end this is just a career choice for now. Not the end of the world - ignore them and keep pressing on.

Data engineering is a very important field, but it is new, often under-appreciated, and rarely discussed relative to its close cousin Data Science.

&#x200B;

Just some food for thought.

&#x200B;

A debate on PhD yes vs PhD no would be one of those sterile how-long-is-a-piece-of-string type of questions, because you cannot generalise. But one thing I have noticed is that people with a very theoretical background tend to struggle to adapt to a business world in which it is often best to spend 1 hour to get 90% of the answer, as they'd rather spend 3 days to get the full answer. Which isn't to say that a PhD is useless, of course not - I just mean that PhD graduates must realise that the business world is very different from academia.

6201,guuer4,Do less Data Science,,"That's why we're all here, right? 

I'd like to share with you a nice little story. I've recently been working on a difficult scoring problem that determined a rank from numerous features. There were numerous issues: which features were most important, did it make sense to have so many features, do we condense them, do we take the mean and so on. I had been working on this problem for weeks, and after numerous measurements, reports, reading and testing, I conked out -- I gave up. 

Man, Data Science was done for me; I was so over it. I started talking more with my colleagues in different departments, primarily in PR. I just felt like doing something else for a few days. I asked one of my colleagues in PR, ""so, what would you do if you had to rank X, Y, and Z?"" ""Hmm... I'm not so sure, I think I would be more interested in Z than X, why is X even necessary?"" She was right. Statistically, X was absolutely necessary in many of my modes. My boss thought this was the key to solving our problem, why would she think it's unnecessary? It turns out... as Data Scientists, we weren't the ones using the product. My colleague -- bless her soul -- is exactly our target audience. We were so in solutions mode, we forgot to just think about the problem and WHOM it concerns. 

I decided to take a walk and put pen to paper. I even asked the barista at the local cafe. It was so obvious. 

We were solving the WRONG problem the whole time -- well, at least we weren't making it any easier for ourselves.

To all of the great DS minds out there, sometimes we need to stop and reset.

6211,gap9nc,Seeking Advice: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses and is pressuring me with deadlines. What to do?,,"I work as a data scientist at a medium-sized company (with \~200 employees). I've been with the company for a little over 4 months. My salary is $90K/year in a city where the cost of living is relatively cheap. (For perspective, $1200/month for 2-bedroom-2-bathroom apartment.) I have a BI analyst as my boss and I have another boss who's a BI director.

The BI team in our office is small. Just 3 of us in the office. The issue I have is that my bosses don't understand the complexity of running a valid analysis, which is forcing me to cut corners and produce sub-par quality work. Those sub-par quality analyses then get criticized by people in other departments (e.g. finance people, data scientists in other offices, etc.) and it makes me look like an idiot.

Don't get me wrong. My bosses are hardworking, smart people. They can write complex SQL code and make stunningly beautiful Tableau dashboards. However, they don't have any statistical background to properly design studies and go through the proper procedures to come to accurate conclusions. But they care too much about how beautiful the presentations must be (font, color, company branding, etc.) and meeting deadlines instead of focusing on the important stuffs, like valid experimental procedures and properly separating out correlation from causation.

I would say that the overall company culture is very healthy. The CEO is super transparent about the company matters. Everyone is very open and caring. The company sent a lot of care packages during the quarantine for the employees and they also host weekly fun company-wide activities. They give great medical and health benefits as well as PTO.

I thought about quitting because not having enough time and resources that I need to do my job is making me look incompetent. I haven't quit yet because:

1. I don't think many other companies are hiring amid this quarantine crisis,
2. I have a criminal background so I'm not sure if there is any other company that's willing to risk hiring me.

What should I do? At this rate, I'm gonna continue looking like an idiot and maybe I'll lose my job.

TLDR: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses so I'm producing sub-par quality work. What should I do?

6219,daxwf4,Mid career advice for an ML generalist: Update,,"[A few weeks ago I posted that I was having trouble with mid-senior level interviews.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0qz6h/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist/) Since then I‚Äôve changed a few things and had much better responses (3 onsite invitations and 2 offers). I've just signed an offer that I‚Äôm pretty happy with, and wanted to update you on some of the things that I think helped the most.

# Company size

I was applying pretty randomly to a lot of different size companies, turns out my sweet spot seems to be startups with 10-20 employees who don‚Äôt have an ML manager yet. (I don't have enough management experience to go for manager roles at larger companies). I think this is because I‚Äôve had too many experiences with bad managers that I don‚Äôt really trust them, so I probably put out a prickly vibe in interviews that puts people off.

# Age(ism)

I do a lot better when interviewed by older people, like 40-50+, they seem to have more respect for my PhD and life experience rather than just trying to catch me out on something I don‚Äôt know off the top of my head. Luckily the tech bubble (e.g. 20-year old founders of [juice startups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/09/01/silicon-valleys-infamous-400-juicer-startup-is-shutting-down/)) is settling down, I think I read somewhere that most successful startups are actually founded by 40+ year olds, so hopefully the industry will go more back to the way it was in the 80s and 90s.

# Statistics

I‚Äôve never really got statistics on a deep level (my PhD is in pure math) so have always struggled with stats questions in interviews, e.g. ‚Äúthere are two groups of users each one does a certain number of clicks per day, how do you know if one is more than the other.‚Äù Stats just seemed like a random bag of z scores and t tests and I don‚Äôt even really believe in p-values; I‚Äôd remember enough to stumble my way thorough, and then say something about bootstrapping confidence intervals when I couldn‚Äôt, but it made me come across as pretty weak. What turned it around for me was reading ‚ÄúStatistical Rethinking‚Äù by Richard McElreath: writing out the equations for statistical models gives me confidence when I‚Äôm talking ( I come from a math background) and then I can just say that I would run MCMC to get the coefficients.

I‚Äôve also screwed up a few interviews with time series data from sensors (outlier detection etc) ... I still don‚Äôt really know how to approach these.

# ML models

This was one of the biggest things I was doing wrong in retrospect. When I was asked ‚Äútell me something you‚Äôve done that you‚Äôre proud of‚Äù I‚Äôd tell stories about powerful business results I‚Äôd achieved using simple models like heuristics, logistic regression or random forests together with more organisational things like clarifying metrics and objective functions with stakeholders, product/design thinking, evolving data-labeling practices, and testing models in production as soon as possible.

Lol turns out people don‚Äôt want to hear about any of this, maybe it made them think that I just plug data into a black box and don‚Äôt understand how it works? Anyway things turned around for me when I dropped all the business stuff and started just talking about (the one time) when I read a research paper, implemented the algorithm in PyTorch and got a meaningful gain in accuracy.

# Engineering

You guys were right, I didn't need more engineering experience, I'm already pretty strong for a data scientist, I was just doubting myself due to my current company (which doesn't have a data science org) gaslighting me into taking a lower pay grade.

Anyway hope this is useful to some of you, definitely going to approach my next job search differently although maybe things will be different by then anyway and I might be going for more management-level roles. Have any of you had similar experiences?",,237,datascience
6220,dmoht4,Quick notes on applying to entry-level analyst/DS roles,,"Hey all

Just wanted to share three quick pointers I think might be valuable as someone who got an entry level analyst role on a data science team at a start-up and is now hiring for one:

1) *Data cleaning, data cleaning, data cleaning*: These are the golden words on the resume. Most companies today are trying to apply ML to really complicated real-world problems, which means messy data. If you talk about experience where you have cleaned messy real-world data in detail, that will put you ahead of other candidates.

2) *Generic Projects*: We all know them: housing price regression, MNIST, the flower one, Twitter sentiment analyses, MovieLens recommendation system, etc. Having done these isn't *bad* necessarily, but to someone with who has been around the block of online machine learning courses, these aren't all that impressive. Filling out your resume with original, even if they are relatively simple, projects and models that incorporate data cleaning is much more attention-grabbing.

3) *Why??*: I don't really mind people who message me on LinkedIn, deduce my work email or go to the effort of writing cover letters but you aren't really doing much for yourself if all you are saying is ""Hey I saw the job, I think I am qualified, can I have the job?"". That is what everyone who is applying is saying, you're just being more annoying about it. If you look into our company, even just regurgitate our mission statement in your cover letter, it at least shows you aren't just spraying and praying. I would be more likely to consider someone less qualified who communicated why they want this job, not just a job.

6227,edtagd,[POSSIBLY CONTROVERSIAL] What is the best mindset to make sure you are at the top of your game at 40-50? Which aspect of data-science is most future proof? Making it immune to outsourcing? As I [29M] join the workforce and will focus on having a family.,,"I apologize in advance if anything I say is controversial. I'm genuinely curious about the future of this line of career and don't mean to offend anyone from any country.

I'm currently 29M, about to finish my PhD in a STEM field. A huge lesson I've learned, being involved in research, startups and big corporations is that programmers and coders are just a workforce, which can be bought, used and then put on the shelf. The availability of good programmers is growing every year, especially with most software tools being freely available and huge competition from programmers from developing countries such as India and China. Additionally, I can clearly see things headed towards automation of programming.  Expertise in a tool-set might lead to short-term job prospects, but one can easily be replaced/automated. I'm planning a career in medical data-science. The deep learning models I'm building now for my PhD won't be a novelty very soon as computers get more powerful and infrastructures are setup to perform standard machine learning and deep learning at the click of a button/ call of a function, instead of needing to develop them in Tensorflow/PyTorch/Caffe/Scikit-Learn/R. Platforms such as R, Weka etc are headed that way currently.

There's a few things I've figured which will be difficult to automate and requires domain expertise and good communication skills. I'd love any comments on the following ways to secure a good career for the next 10-15 years. This is pure speculation of course:

1. Data Engineer: Expertise in the pre-learning stage, involving data pre-processing, cleaning, feature building  and maintenance of the data pipeline. This requires domain knowledge and cannot easily be performed by a generic data-scientist. This seems to be the most technically challenging and interesting.
2. Data Analyst: Great communication skills to convince the stakeholders/managers using the information provided by the data scientist. This seems quite future-proof however, the job focus seems to shift more towards communication, relying on soft-skills with a good working knowledge of data science. Requires good understanding of statistics. But having seen my friends attend multiple meetings trying to explain the meaning of statistics to the managers, I'm not sure this one is for me. 
3. Manager: Managing a team of data engineers, scientists, analysts. One level removed from the analysts. Less involvement with technology and more with people management skills. Personally, this doesn't interest me. I can see the appeal of this position for others though.
4. Data Scientist: Feel like this is at most risk of being automated. The models being used can be put in a standard infrastructure for ensemble methods, making the process of creating models from scratch redundant. Hyper-customized models however, would still be in demand.
5. Multi-disciplinary Data Science Application Engineer: This has been the most interesting discovery. Use of machine learning/statistical/deep learning techniques to develop a model that can be used as part of another ecosystem. For example, using a well-trained NLP sentiment analyzer for prediction of body posture and using MoCap for validation. Essentially, combining multiple technologies for building a product, instead of pure data-science for reporting/business intelligence. My PhD has been along these lines so far.

Hope I'm thinking along the correct lines. Seeing the fast changing ecosystem of A.I./M.L./Data-science got me thinking about future career prospects as I enter the stage in my life to increase my focus on building a family and providing for them. Thus, limiting the amount of time I can dedicate to keeping on top of technologies/trends and require career stability. I'm extremely open to any suggestions/criticisms/corrections.

6228,c4asvf,Data Analyst at a fortune500 company...not what I expected.,,"So I recently got hired as in intern at this company and so far, everything they tell me to do is very vague and nonspecific.

My supervisor gave me a task to finish a ""spec"" without really clarifying it. We have a task to perform automatic summation on certain parts of the data storage place. However it's not an easy task.

The part that is frustrating is that there's no real direction. They haven't given me full access to the data storage place. Nor have they spent any time explaining how the product or data is stored or even what the column titles and abbreviations mean. Meanwhile, I'm supposed to finish this ""spec"". Every time I finish it, they change what I'm working on.

After a week I've still not had a clear direction and my final draft is supposed to be done Wednesday. They recently gave me an Excel document to solve this problem, which I did. But didn't tell me what we're going to implement it with, so no idea if my excel solving is even going to be used as it could be used in SQL. 

The job required me to know Python, R, and SQL. But so far when brining any ideas using those programs to my boss, I'm told we haven't had any plans to use any of those programs yet.

Is this normal?

Tl;dr Fortune 500 company giving me vague and unexplained tasks and has no real program language to work in.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses. Although I do believe that you need to take initiative, it can be hard when the goal objective is not clear, especially on your first week. However, I've taken this advice and have put things in my own hands. I've scheduled a few meetings and have taken it upon myself to solve and better the system. This company pays well and I know I can use my skills and education to do some great work. This position is just the tip of the iceberg before I dive deeper into eventual data science.

6230,e6s20u,"After being in a data science/ developer role for the better part of a decade, here is how companies REALLY develop software and AI/ML applications [OC]",,"Here at random.ai startup, we‚Äôre reaching our late stage of maturity as a company and I want to share some of our keys to success. At random.ai we enthusiastically follow a well-designed execution methodology that has been developed and calibrated over many years. Software development methodologies come and go, and perspectives change. We embrace the Agile SDLC. The beautiful thing about agile is to adopt it, all you have to do is say you‚Äôre agile. And the more you talk about being agile, the more agile you are.

In order to achieve lightning fast delivery speed, we jump directly into development and skip the analysis, requirements and design steps (which are common phases in other, less effective, methodologies). In order to ensure alignment and rapid cycle time, we set milestone deadlines and scope before wasting time on understanding the complexity of the business problem at hand. A key success factor is that the decision makers and product/project plan owners have little or no knowledge of the technological challenges that will be encountered during future phases. To build great technology, we strategically organize our execution teams to minimize the number of people who are writing the code. Our rule of thumb is for every one technologist (i.e. developer, engineer or data scientist), there should be at least four non-technical project team members. This will provide the necessary capacity for these additional resources to determine **what** the technologist will do, **when** they should do it by, and most importantly, **how** they should do it. An important characteristic for successful projects is for the project team to collect a backlog of diverse, unrelated, and unclear tasks and assign them to the developers the moment they think of them. The more our developers and data scientists multi-task, the more tasks can be completed.

A core priority for a sustainable revenue stream on existing products is maintenance- the time spent maintaining existing code and pipelines. Our strategy on investing in maintenance is to do none at all - we can maintain a massive pipeline of new product development by not getting bogged down and distracted doing preemptive maintenance on legacy code. We have rapid, lightweight prioritization of fixing legacy code- instead of crawling through old code that‚Äôs already working, it‚Äôs better to wait for it to break and allow our clients to discover the problem and raise it to us. This makes prioritization incredibly easy- once the problem is raised, we mobilize resources immediately to fix the problem. Again, this aligns with our philosophy that multi-tasking developers are productive developers.

We find that our most successful project teams and middle managers are always thinking of ways create value for clients faster. We even have a special phrase for these internally: ""short cuts"". So many companies fall victim to spending time building extensible, easily modifiable systems that have staying power over time. Those companies are guaranteed to never reach a billion dollar valuation. Things like robust error handling, load/unit/regression testing, modularization of code, documentation- all distractions preventing you from realizing value faster. For example, we recently had a case where we needed to implement a critical bug fix. A sales rep had the idea of a short cut that led to an incredibly fast turn-around of one week- great ideas really do come from anywhere! We know the short cut was decisively faster than the slow traditional route, because we had to do the fix to the same code three times, each took the same amount of time- one week, and the senior developer‚Äôs original estimate was two weeks! This is the out-of-the-box thinking that separates good companies from great ones.

Any competent person in the data products or AI/ML industry will tell you the same thing- having a well-thought-out data quality strategy is a survival necessity. We achieved a 100% efficiency gain in our quality assurance efforts by removing them entirely from our dev cycle. We haven‚Äôt failed a test case since the decision, and we‚Äôre getting products out the door faster because of it.

The last, but certainly not least, critical component of our execution methodology and philosophy is our talent. Our people are our greatest asset. After years of trying out different org structures- we have, what I believe to be, the truly optimal structure and our key to success is our management team. With respect to head count, we like to have as many mid-level managers as individual contributors. This ensures our individual contributors have the support they need: one half of the company is working tirelessly to support the other half who is doing actual work. Our managers really roll up their sleeves and get into the weeds- really managing all the way down at the most micro level possible.

I hope that you too can gain success using these philosophies and strategies I‚Äôve shared. Here at random.ai, we‚Äôre excited to be disrupting the future of cloud native, deep learning powered blockchain knowledge graph data lakes - our CNDLPBKGDL offering which is releasing to beta next year. We‚Äôre disrupting the world by disrupting ourselves- because at random.ai, we're solving yesterday‚Äôs problems tomorrow, because tomorrow, today will be yesterday.

Edit: so apparently it‚Äôs not entirely clear to all readers that this is a satirical piece. I have been in a data science/ developer roles for the last eight years, and have seen these trends at multiple companies. All of the above are symptomatic of not knowing how to manage a technology company or technology teams. The satire in this comes from the absurdity of the ‚Äústrategy‚Äù defined above- nobody would actually brag about doing some of these things, but companies fall into it via ignorance, politics, or whatever reason.",,230,datascience

A bit of everything, really.

At the end of 2018 i have left my company: i wasn't feeling well overall, as the environment there wasn't really good. Now i am searching for another position, always as a data scientist. It seems impossible to me to get employed. I pass the first interview, they give me a take-home test and then I can't seem to pass to the following stages. The tests are always a variation of:

* Work that the company tries to outsource to the people applying, so they can reuse the code for themselves.

* Kaggle-like ""competitions"", where you have been given some data to clean and model... Without a clear purpose.

* Live questions on things i have studied 3 or more years ago (like what is the domain of tanh)

* Software engineer work

Like, what happened to business understanding? How am i able to do a good work without knowledge of the company? How can i know what to expect? How can I show my thinking process on a standardized test? I mean, i won't be the best coder ever, but being able to solve a business problem with data science is not just ""code on this data and see what happens"".

Most importantly, i feel like my studies and experiences aren't worth anything.

6248,bcgoy7,A Warning on University of Michigan Coursera Courses,,"Hi all,

As a person who's first exposure to data science was on Coursera, it has a somewhat special place in my heart. The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization was a great way to get myself introduced into the world of data science, and the further I got through the course, the more I felt like I wanted to do this for a living. And I managed to pull that off! The only downside is that R is my specialty, and I currently work in a predominately Python atmosphere. So I thought what better way to spruce up my Python techniques than taking some more Coursera courses, right?

&#x200B;

Well, to my dismay, the University of Michigan's Data Science with Python classes are a disorganized mess. The professors clearly haven't updated things in the course for years. The videos had errors galore, there were errors in the assignments that we were given, and the notes were filled with outdated code that has been done away with since Python has been updated. It's one thing to encourage users to hop on the discussion forum for better learning and discussion between peers and professionals, but I found the discussion forum was just filled with ways to get around the errors that the instructors left behind for the user to deal with. While these were not meant to be courses in Python debugging, they turned out to be that way.

&#x200B;

So to make a long story short, if you're interested in learning Python for data science, I can not recommend these courses. This is not to say that everything on Coursera is garbage. As I mentioned, the Johns Hopkins classes arguably got me the job I have today. But if you're jumping in to these ideas for the first time, the University of Michigan does not make data science a fun subject to learn. Instead, they turn it into a specialization of jumping through hoops to get a certification, and needless to say, that's not how people learn.

&#x200B;

If you've had better experiences in other courses, please comment below to help fellow readers out! I'd be curious to know as well!

EDIT: A good point was made, below in the comments. To be more specific, the courses I took were the first three in the specialization, ie.  Intro to Data Science with Python, Applied Plotting, Charting, and Data Representation in Python, and Applied Machine Learning in Python.",,228,datascience

I've applied to over 60 places since August and have gotten over 15 rejections so far and only one place was willing to give me a coding test which they rejected me after. I am so  downtrodden and defeated, I have no clue what I am doing wrong.

I've  talked to multiple professors, HR at work, career services, and they all have said that I am doing everything right in their eyes. I'm starting research next semester with my AI professor and I am planning to make a chatbot over winter break, so those will help my skills but I am not sure how much of that I can really even show off on a job application. I am also retaking the AI class I already took and got an A in because my professor is changing it to include machine learning. I'm also taking some 400 level stats classes next year.

Eventually I want to go to grad school for data science. I just want to start now gaining experience because I really enjoy doing and learning abut this stuff. Am I just not competitive enough? I know I don't have much experience but isn't that want an internship is for? It's so so so disheartening, it's really hard not to question my capability of being in this field and if I should just stick with software engineering.

However, search engines for code are often frustrating and never fully understand what we want, unlike regular web search engines. We started using modern machine learning techniques to improve code search but quickly realized that we were unable to measure our progress. Unlike natural language processing with [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmarks, there is no standard dataset suitable for code search evaluation.

While this data is not directly related to code search, its pairing of code with related natural language description is suitable to train models for this task.

6273,b8kvew,Data Science Panel: What Makes a Great Data Scientist,,"The first question we had for the panel came courtesy of /u/RyBread7:

**""What are the qualities or traits which differentiate good data scientists from the best data scientists? How, if at all, can these traits be learned or acquired?""**


Panelist Answers:
_______________________________________________________
/u/creampuffcrusader:

The best data scientists I've worked with had these two traits:

**A deeply rooted paranoia about data quality.**

Starting out a project by trying to replicate KPIs and current domain knowledge before jumping into the new and exciting work. Talking to stewards of the data about any quirks they ran into and taking the time to understand the data generating process. This can be learned either from mentor-ship or from experience. For me personally - it was combination of both mentorship and collecting battle scars.

**Holding themselves to the scientific method***

I had a mentor who was a data scientist before it was cool. He started the quantitative supply chain practice at the firm I work in back when the data scientist equivalent position was called Principal Analyst. He had this motto when interviewing stakeholders:

Tribal knowledge is a hypothesis unless there is evidence.
He had this uncanny ability of organizing knowledge by what has been verified, what can be verified, and what is interesting but maybe out of scope or not testable. And using this categorization to efficiently guide us to a quality analysis or product. Really - he was just very strictly holding himself and his team to the scientific method. It was remarkable.

This trait can definitely be learned. But it takes patience and experience.

_______________________________________________________
/u/amadeusmagrabi:

In my experience, the best data scientists are the ones who have **an intrinsic drive to deliver value for the business** and are **able to think outside the box to make sure that the whole team has the highest impact.**

Good data scientists ask their manager what the project requirements are, do their research, deliver a clean and thorough analysis, communicate their most important findings clearly and then ask what they should work on next.

Great data scientists take a more active approach and think about their work with more context. They ask what the larger goal of the project is and challenge the core assumptions. They have ideas for how a project could also benefit other parts of the company or raise awareness for potential conflicts that could occur down the line. They are informed about new frameworks or techniques that come out and suggest innovative ways how they could be used to improve a process. They are genuinely interested in how the business as a whole works and actively talk to people to understand their perspectives. They are full of ideas of what they should work on next. They pride themselves on how many people they helped and not on how complicated the technique they used was.

Importantly, they do all of this because they care about the impact of their work and not because they want the attention or boost their career. They do not start a discussion just for the sake of having a discussion and they are able to step back when their opinions did not resonate with others.

*As to how to acquire these skills:* 

If you do not have a data science job yet, this is hard to prepare. But it helps to read blog posts in which companies from different industries share how they get value out of their data (there are plenty of those on Medium).

Once you have a job, ask as many questions as possible without being too annoying and talk to everyone in the company. Do not be shy and just sit in front of your data. Constantly ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, if it still makes sense or if there is a better way. Get involved, be curious and let others know about your thoughts. The more feedback you get on your thoughts, the better you can fine-tune your work to the business context.

_______________________________________________________
/u/tsutomu45
 
This depends on the role of the data scientist and the company.

In a tech company where seconds (and milliseconds) matter, then your knowledge of algorithms, statistical learning, and programming matters a lot.

However, if you're in a non-tech company, where data scientists tend to be more ""decision scientists"", and the transactions happen across days or weeks (think buying a car), then the ""soft-skills"" tend to dominate...things like understanding the business, iterating rapidly, and explaining results to non-math/non-engineering executives.

Both are learn-able. However, in my experience the latter (soft skills) are harder to teach.
_______________________________________________________
/u/dfphd:

There are three things that come to mind:

* **They are driven by outcomes and not methods - but can do either well.** 

The best data scientists I've met are the people that are willing to put their ego aside and cobble together a less elegant answer in two days than a more elegant answer in a week because that's what's right for the project. That's not to say that they cannot put together a complex, elegant solution to a problem - when the problem/project calls for it, they can roll their sleeves up and make that happen. But their bias is for getting results, not getting methodologies.

* **They say ""yes"" more often than ""no""**

It's really easy to say no. We can't do that, that can't be done, that won't work, no, no, no. Really good data scientists say yes - knowing that they may need to change the question for it to work, but understanding that they can likely figure something productive out.

* **They build strong relationships based on work credibility**

These people tend to do more than just be good at their job - they seem to always manage to leverage the quality of their work into really strong relationships at work, which in turn helps them be even more effective by having a lot of people who are willing to go to bat for them when needed. I think the first two attributes tend to help in building these relationships, but there is extra effort and time that they dedicate to cultivate these relationships over time.

Learning these skills, in my opinion, is largely driven by introspection, i.e., identifying that your objective should be to become as effective and efficient as possible, and that you may need to modify your behaviors, your habits, your comfort zone in order to become that person. Once you can legitimately convince yourself that these are skills worth developing, the rest becomes an exercise in keeping yourself honest - in constantly call yourself out when you are being a method-diva, when you're being a naysayer, and when you're marginalizing your relationships at work.",,212,datascience

6278,ga23pe,Feeling stuck since one year at data science job. Need career advice.,,"Pay: 80k. Medium col city YoE: 2.5

**TL;dr: DS job doesn't have ML/modelling work. Underpaid. Imposter syndrome kicking in. Want to switch jobs but afraid that I didn't build good experience to apply to bigger more challenging roles. Feeling stuck. Thinking of switching to swe since my statistics and ML growth hasn't been too good at current role. Need advice. More details below.**

I'm a data scientist, and I've been working on the same application for an year or two. I don't see it changing. Most of my experience has been writing spark code and  dev ops and cloud infra work for an application that we build. There's a bit of prototyping work here and there. And some business case development with upper management. The team is really small. And there are no senior members in the DS team. The only thing that I like about it is that I have positioned myself to become the most experienced person in the team on a product that we work on so i get to have a lot of say in the dev process.

I never go to do any ML or statistical modelling at this job. It was my first job after college, and I have severe imposter syndrome kicking in. So now I don't feel like a data scientist, and I'm becoming disillusioned with the field. My MS in data scientist is going to waste since I'm not using the ML and stats I learned. I am afraid to apply to other data science jobs since I feel that I will not be able to clear a DS interview round when it comes to describing what I've done with stats and ML and deep learning. I can study and practice sure but experience matters a lot, and if I don't have that, the only DS jobs I would be able to land in the future would be title inflated analyst roles.

I might switch to a software engineering role with maybe an ML focus because I fear I didn't build any relevant experience for the type of jobs that I want in DS but I have good experience and love writing python, plus coding in general. And I'm also tired of the lack of strong software dev practices in DS teams. I want to go somewhere where I can build things and code more than I do, with a more engineering focused team. Do you think DS jobs with actually challenging work will be harder to get into since I don't have modelling/ML experience?

My company is willing to start Green Card process, and then I'll be stuck here for a couple of years. At least my gc will process faster since processing dates for my nationality is current. It also makes staying at my current role more attractive since I don't know if newer companies would be willing to file GC straight away.

And then there is coronavirus.

&#x200B;

**APOLOGIES**, there was an error in some of the courses (the feedback on two were mixed up, unfortunately) it has since been fixed.

&#x200B;

**June-16-2019: UPDATE**: I completed two new CV courses:

1. Coursera Andrew Ng course on Convolutional Neural Networks
2. New Udemy course, this time using PyTorch - [PyTorch for Deep Learning and Computer Vision](https://www.udemy.com/pytorch-for-deep-learning-and-computer-vision/)

&#x200B;

**Some NEWS,** there's going to be an officia[l OpenCV Tutorial](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/satyamallick/ai-courses-by-opencvorg) coming out soon. Should be one of the best when it's out!

**May UPDATE**: Just wanted to post an update to my initial reviews :) as it's now **6 courses were reviewed.**

&#x200B;

I made this post on a couple of other subreddit's a week ago, but thought I'd share it here too.

I'm working at a startup whereas the 'Chief' Data Scientist (re: the only person), I was tasked with learning computer vision for a new application we're developing.

My background is in Mathematics, I've used R extensively. I know some Python for a course I completed in College, but I'm not pro. Previously, most of my work involved performing Data Analytics, with some simple modeling.

The company paid for all courses mentioned below and I took roughly 3 months to complete almost all of them (still had most of my full-time tasks to do, so I wasn't dedicated 100% to learning Computer Vision).

**Review** \- This is a very good course. Basic, but well taught and focused well on PyTorch. What I didn't like is that it lacks more advanced content. As such it feels a bit shallow when compared to the other courses. Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught

\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs

\- Transfer Learning is well taught

\- Teaches PyTorch very well

**Cons**:

\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory

\- Lacks cool projects

**Score - 4.2/5**

[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \- by Andrew Ng

**Review** \- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into the complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.

\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!

\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics

**Cons**:

\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.

\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.

\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.

**Score - 4.5/5**

**Review** \- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.

**Pros**:

\- Good variety of core content

\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)

\- Fun projects

**Cons**:

\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basics before moving onto a project.

\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed.

**Score - 4.2/5**

[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) \-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#instructor-1)

I enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.

**Pros:**

\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well

\- All code works

\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value

\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow

**Cons:**

\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free

\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do

**Score 4.3/5**

[Deep Learning Computer Vision‚Ñ¢ CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD & GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

I loved this course! It was my go-to reference for doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like ""here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this"". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)

**Pros:**

\- Amazing and detailed content

\- Excellent theoretical explanations

\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things

\- Very fun projects!

\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV

\- New content always being added it seems!

**Cons:**

\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.

\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code

\- Some of the content is text, not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.

[Computer Vision Intro‚Ñ¢ OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

This is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also, the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!

**Pros:**

\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought

\- All code works and explanations are on point!

\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff

\- Fun Projects

\- Enthusiast Lecturer

**Cons:**

\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)

\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides

**Score - 4.3/5**

[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/?couponCode=REDDITCV)  \- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)

**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized I might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taught really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.

I enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. It goes into good detail about implementing and building the CNN's he teaches. Overall, good course, just not as much wide content as some of the others but still good at what it does!

**Pros:**

\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well

\- If you like code-along courses this is for you

\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well

**Cons:**

\- He doesn't step outside a few things, but the things he teaches are taught very well too! So it's not a real con per se

\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time for me. I get why many people like it, but to me, it slows me down (could just be my impatience)

\- It lacks a wide variety of projects

**Score - 4.3/5**

**NOTE**: The lazyprogrammer has a second course that seems quite good on GANs and Variational Autoencoders

[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) \- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)

(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)

This is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!

The code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.

**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.

&#x200B;

**Pros:**

\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online

\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher

\- All code is explained nicely

\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics

**Cons:**

\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course

\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)

\- Expensive!

**Score - 4.5/5**

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

&#x200B;

Even though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).

&#x200B;

**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles

* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.
* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning
* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.

&#x200B;

In summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.

I took some of the advice and talked to the project leader. He said he understood and felt the same way. But he didn‚Äôt say much else, and it sort of went unsaid that, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it works‚Äù.  I finished the project. A presentation was scheduled for the first day I was off on a 2-week vacation. When I came back, I notice that all my exhibits that didn‚Äôt support the desired result had been removed. At that point I was sort of over the whole thing. They still didn‚Äôt convince anyone that it was a good idea. People asked about methodology and what was missing, and they had to admit that it didn‚Äôt support the conclusion. It was decided that the desired action wouldn‚Äôt be worth it.

That said, there are a number of managers who still think it will be a good idea. I‚Äôm now the guy who has to explain that, no, your intuition was wrong. Yes, I know we planned for this in the business plan. No, I didn‚Äôt miss anything. The data suggests that implementing the changes are a bad idea, but if you think the analysis is wrong, go ahead and do it anyway.

Some things I‚Äôve learned from all this:

1. Document your methodology and be transparent!! My work was combed over thoroughly by many people who were hoping I‚Äôd done it wrong. I was very detailed and clear in my documentation. I kept a research notebook, commented code, and and made everything reproducible. This helped support my point. Just the fact that I was extra transparent (more than others on my team) gave me a lot more credence.

2. Don‚Äôt be confrontational. Let the data do the talking. I think I ended up looking better than I might have because I didn‚Äôt argue my point. I just put the data out there and it did the talking for me.

3. Know when to walk away. This wasn‚Äôt worth making a big deal about. I resigned myself to do what I had to do to finish the project and move on. But I‚Äôm looking to move on to a new company. I lost a lot of respect for some higher up people. Worse, I think people are rewarded more for political reasons than for adding value. I don‚Äôt want to spend my career playing politics. So I‚Äôm going to find something else. (If anyone is hiring data analysts in the DC area, feel free to PM me.)



Original post:

Using a burner account since a couple work people know my normal username.

I‚Äôve been doing more-or-less data science work for about two years at a very large, very established company. You would know the name if I mentioned it. I do some modeling but, honestly, most people just want graphs and tables of particular things they suspect would lead to something profitable.The requests are often something like, ‚ÄúHey, I think there may be a relationship to XYZ and decreased customer churn. Can you throw together some views for me?‚Äù  The higher up you go, the less people trust fancy models that they can‚Äôt understand. They want a nice scatter plot that makes it obvious. And I get that. You gotta sell an idea somehow.

Anyway, I‚Äôve started working on more high profile projects. One project started about 9 months ago and required getting a large data set from a vendor. This took months. In the meantime, more and more high level people started talking about it. The idea of the project was to show that action X would reduce customer churn. This was pretty much assumed to be true, and the analysis was necessary to figure out how much of action X, when, and how much benefit we could expect.

People got excited about this. SVPs we‚Äôre checking in on the status, anxiously awaiting the benefits. When planning for next year, many tacitly assumes this would bring a boost to overall sales and would help them meet more aggressive targets.

The only problem is they‚Äôre all wrong. We got the data and I‚Äôve been crunching it for a month now. No matter how you model it, graph it, slice or dice it, this relationship they assumed existed doesn‚Äôt. Now the supervisor on the project is freaking out. We spent a lot of time on this and a lot of money on the data. People expect to see at least some kind of result. This morning, I was told that ‚Äúwe have to deliver what they expect, even in a small way. We can‚Äôt just say there‚Äôs nothing here worthwhile.‚Äù

I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm expected to manufacture results that simply aren‚Äôt real. I don‚Äôt feel very comfortable with that. And since this started, I‚Äôve noticed that similar problems are not uncommon. People use analyses based on sparse data and unsound conclusions to make convenient decisions. It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess I‚Äôd say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.

I already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect me‚Äîwhether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. It‚Äôs really stressing me out. I‚Äôve started drinking a lot more and it‚Äôs definitely hurting my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Advice? Is this common?",,203,datascience

6285,9zbff6,Just read this interview with Roger Peng about the best books on Data Science and something he said really made me think,,"Here's the link to the interview - [https://fivebooks.com/best-books/data-science-roger-peng/](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/data-science-roger-peng/) where he talks about Data Science and recommends some books.

His final book recommendation  - a book about ""Design Thinking"" is very surprising - he says  


>Being a person who‚Äôs done a lot of data analysis, one thing that I‚Äôve found frustrating is the lack of proper mental model for what is going on when you analyse data. Most universities have a class called ‚Äòdata analysis‚Äô, and typically it presents various useful tools, but rarely discusses what actually happens when you do the analysis itself. *Design Thinking* gives a mental model to describe what happens in this process

&#x200B;

So it got me thinking - in my experience the most challenging and exciting part of working with data is thinking things through, seeing if I'm asking the right question, what we should be looking for, etc. Looking at it that way, that recommendation makes a lot of sense.  


What do you guys think?

6293,b15rra,Interview Rant from Experienced Data Scientist,,"Incompetent interviewers are so frustrating. Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks 

""Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.""

Well then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking ""Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about."" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.

He then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.

He then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.

I get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. 

What's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say ""Well at least I don't have to work with him."" But from talking to the other guy, I think I would have actually fit in really well there, and I just had bad luck by getting this one guy as an interviewer.

Anyway I guess there's not much I can do. Rant over.",,196,datascience

6295,71lsm1,"After 7 months, I've finally made a career change into Data Science and Analytics!!!",,"A little bit of background... About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  

I started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!

With my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.

Up until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.

After updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  

I quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!

I hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!

TL;DR
Bored of my current job, wanted a career change
Took some online courses to learn Python, R, and SQL
Created pretty resume
Applied to every job under the sun

an open source, community driven '[tech tree](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm)' of canonical ML problems, accompanied with lessons and code on how to solve each problem.  The tree begins with 101/hello world level ML problems.  Each problem progressively builds on the concepts of the previous problems, with increasing complexity through a few well-defined learning paths through the tech tree.  Content is kept current/in pace state of the art by community submissions and a committee of qualified curators.

**/tl;dr**

&nbsp;

Background on me:  I'm an engineer who made a feeble jump to 'citizen data science' in 2017.  sum total of my education are the courses at fast.ai, by /u/jeremyhoward .  I'm a programmer, not a math PhD (which is why the fast.ai courses appealed to me).  I also have a background in developing IT curriculum, which is why I am posting this. 

And, I'm *quite sure* that the 'how do you get started in Data Science' question has too many answers out there, and none of them are great.   I'll hack a quote together, stolen from [Paul Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) and reworded to be relevant to this problem (**bold** are my edits):

> our present system of **data science** education is precisely this kind of nightmare. In
> fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a **person's** natural
> curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn‚Äôt possibly do as good a job as is currently being
> done‚Äî I simply wouldn‚Äôt have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soulcrushing
> ideas that constitute contemporary **data science** education.

&nbsp;

**Here's are the problems I see with the current state:**

* Too many (very convincing) answers out there to the 'how to get started' question. (blog posts, moocs, reddit threads, etc).
* The answers are typically incomplete due to the *individual* biases of those answering.
* The answers, (and those recommending them after the fact) begin to become stale vs. state-of-the-art the *moment* they are posted.  (e.g. are we seriously still recommending the 2011 Ng course?)
* Most of the learning path recommendations are too frontloaded w formal math/stats heavy for the people typically asking it. Someone who is considering a bona fide Data Science education will *not* need to ask 'how do I get started in Data Science'.  They need help finding a degree program.  Most people asking this question *really* want to become citizen data scientists (bu they don't know it yet).

&nbsp;

**Here is what I envision:**

* A canonical, open source, community driven project maintained in GitHub.
* The content is designed around a **very specific** framework that enforces some core concepts:
    * **problem based:**  Imagine a 'tech tree' of canonical ML/DL problems that represent the center of gravity of *high value* ML/DL methods and techniques.  Like [this](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm), with one problem per domain, and maybe only 20-30 problems total in the tech tree at any given time.
    * **continuously updated:** Continuous improvements are submitted by the community, and curated by a small committee of qualified maintainers, who are curating around a well-define set of criteria.  New problems and accompanying lessons are submitted in a standard format (see below) via pull request 
    * **progressive**: crawl, walk run.  Learning paths always start with the 'hello world' ML examples, and have a few progressive learning paths defined that define 2-3 different journeys through that tech tree, where each subsequent problem builds on principles learned in those before it.  Problems increase in difficulty/complexity as the learner progresses through the chosen learning path.
    * **practical**: learners are writing code and solving problems as a first principle, with real data from the first step, and every subsequent step.  Humans learn by playing the whole game.  (Read David Perkins, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators))
    * **inclusive:**  This is not intended to be a replacement or comparable to a formal Data Science degree program.  The truth is, a formal DS education is *simply not* a prerequisite to using computers and code to answer questions about data, and to understanding how those answers are derived.
    * **emphasizes math:**  The goal isn't to 'cirucumvent' a formal math education, it's to sprinkle it in judiciously along the way, instead of making it a prerequisite.  e.g. hello world problems will branch off to teach the actual math behind linear regression.  When SGD s introduced, we will branch off to teach the actual math behind SGD.  Every problem should be accompanied by a new practical math component that is given nearly as much emphasis as the problem solving/coding.
    * **standardized:**  The learning content for a 'problem' has a well defined and consistent standard:  Problem statement, sample data, solution criteria, list of principles introduced, a math concept, etc.  The format of problem/lesson submissions is a Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step walkthrough of the problem and solution.  Bonus points for embedding a YT video walkthrough in the notebooks.

Thoughts?  Feedback?  Anybody want to help?  I'm qualified to organize and drive this initiative, but I'm not qualified to curate or define the specific problems in the tech tree.

6314,c3vycx,"My issue with ""data science""",,"Note: cross referencing from r/statistics to achieve a greater visibility

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So in the last weeks for various reasons I have been meeting with individuals that identified as data scientists, or that had taken several courses, wether online or in a university, of data science. 

What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance). 

&#x200B;

As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal relationship between the variables.

 In my case I can tell to an extent what is wrong with the design or methodology of the project, but I wonder, now that data science seems to be all the rage, how many people with similar skills have been hired by bussinesses that do not have people with knowledge of statistics, and as result can't know what is wrong with what they do. I know that this is not always true of course, but I worry that it might be relatively extended

6321,f9y4fd,PhD hunger at medium/low-tier companies,,"I'm noticing a trend that I wanted to put out there and get some feedback.

**Background**

I'm a graduate student (not CS or stats) on my last semester, looking for my first full-time position. I was offered a full time DS role at SAP in Palo Alto. My fiance really, really wanted to stay in Chicago. And due to a list of financial reasons, I declined the role. Nonetheless, getting offered the role put some serious wind in my sails.

Well, things are not quite the same in Chicago. Many applications get the automated ""we've moved on to other candidate emails"", other times I make it so the final interview. Nonetheless, several companies far less appealing than SAP have not extended an offer.

**So here's the trend I'm noticing**

In cities like Chicago, the requirements are often ""MS in stats or CS required, PhD in either field heavily preferred."" Yet, in cities like Palo Alto or San Francisco, the explicit requirements are often less stringent, like ""high proficiency with statistics and machine learning accrued through academic of professional experiences."" in fact, this was the language used by SAP.

**My hypothesis**

Companies like SAP, and those more prestigious in the tech world (ie FAANG), *know how to teach the skills they need.* It's okay if you don't have a PhD in CS, they know how to train you. Ultimately, they want to see that you possess *the right mindset to absorb complex material quickly*.

Conversely, I believe most companies in Chicago don't know how data science fits into their organization. They know that they need to spend minimum 80k/yr to staff an entry level role and they can't afford to waste that on the wrong talent. Plus with the population so high and several great universities like (U Chicago and Northwestern) they're able to ask and reasonably expect to catch some PhD level applicants.

Consider this - Google has released ML products like word2vec, BERT, etc. Just in NLP, they're a dominant force. Yet companies that are light years behind from Google seem to think that they'd know how to fully utilize a PhD if they had one. I'd like to laugh, but I'm really just discouraged. My hat's off to self taught DS. You definitely have to prove your worth to lock down a DS role and deserve accolades for doing it.

6326,dqaiqq,"Company culture rarely changes - the reason behind it, and maybe a way to change it",,"I've worked several jobs in my life, and one of the things that I have heard discussed, pitched, sold, bought at every one of them was their idea of a company culture.

""We're a company focused on innovation and teamwork"".

""We are a team that is committed to going above and beyond""

Companies, teams and people will self-assign core values and philosophies as easily as they put on clothes, and there is a general feeling that if you say it enough times, that becomes your culture.

But it isn't, and the very definition of company culture - the real definition - is the same reason why company culture rarely changes.

**The real company culture is the set of behaviors that get people hired and promoted\***

It's that simple. If you declare yourself an ""innovative culture"", but you promote the people who are most willing to defend the old way of doing things... you're not. If you declare yourself of being a high performing culture, but the people that work themselves to death get passed for promotions by the people who play politics, then you're just a political culture. If you declare yourself to be a company that believes in family values, but has VPs that demand their employees to work nights and weekends to meet deadlines... you get the point.

Most importantly, because the people that exhibit these behaviors get hired and promoted faster than the people who don't, your organization will always put its future in the hands of the people who live that culture - the real culture. And that means that it will be *incredibly* rare for someone to be in a position of authority that is willing - let alone able - to challenge that culture. And that is because, by definition, what got them there *is* the culture.

*Why are you posting this?*

Because my current role is one of the few I've had where I have felt happy with the culture, and what it made me realize is that at several of my previous stops I subconsciously was waiting for the culture to change. In some cases, it was their viewpoints on work-life balance. At other stops, it was their commitment to data literacy. 

And those things never changed, and even after I have left and looked back several years later, they haven't changed. And this includes organizations that have had changes at the C-Suite level - several of them. 

**If you are not happy with your company's culture today, you need to start looking for a new job yesterday, because you are on a ride that will make you more and more frustrated each day until you explode.**

And you don't need to do that to yourself. There are too many jobs out there, too many companies to subject yourself to a company culture that doesn't jive with you. More importantly, there are 100% companies out there with healthy cultures that can foster a good career for data scientists, regardless of what your personal preferences as far as work-life balance and everything else might be.

*Ok* u/dfphd*, you mentioned something in the title something about changing company culture. How do you do that?*

Note - this only works in a subset of cases: 

1. Live the values the company wants you to live when everyone outside your team is watching (i.e., get all your work done the way the company wants it done when people are looking)
2. In private, conduct yourself (and your team if you have one) according to the values that you think the company should value *and deliver outstanding results while doing so.* 

You have a company that doesn't value innovation, but rather producing the same 1000 reports every day? Well, keep producing the same 1000 reports every day, but then in ninja mode, come up with an alternate solution that does away with the 1000 reports. And then implement it, and make everything better, and have a bunch of people give it glowing support. 

And then do it again and again and again and again until you start infecting people around you and they want to get some of that same positive feedback you're getting.

Caveats:

1. It works a hell of a lot better if you're an executive. Or at least like an upper-middle manager (e.g., Director).
2. It is *exhausting* both for you and anyone who you may manage.
3. If you ever slip up on your primary work, you will get crucified for spending any level of effort on this other stuff, so you need to be flawless.
4. Even if you do everything right, it may not work.

6328,e2en0j,Failed a job interview - Was my approach wrong?,,"So I currently work as a data scientist, and I recently failed a data science job interview at a large professional services firm. 

The feedback from my interview was that I came across very well, but that I failed on the technical test.

The technical test was to do a Powerpoint presentation of how I would deduplicate a dataset of 10 million rows which contains information such as name, address ect where some of the rows are fuzzy duplicates of other rows. There was no limit placed on the type of approach or packages used. The task was presented as a business problem, 'we need to call individuals in the dataset to get consent to keep their data, we don't want to call the same individual more than once. We have an approaching deadline.'

My approach was to preprocess the data,  split it into chunks, deduplicate a chunk, and then systematically compare the deduplicated chunk with other chunks, and iterate the same process through the remaining chunks.

In the feedback from the interview they said the main reason why I failed is that for the within-chunk-deduplication and comparison-with-other-chunks parts of the process I used a [pre-built package](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#introduction) rather than building one from scratch myself.

To me, building one myself is a waste of time, as I would just be recreating something that already exists. But obviously they thought I did the wrong thing. 

In case something like this comes up again, I would be interested to hear what others think, did I do wrong by using an existing package? Or did they do wrong by expecting candidates to approach the task and not try to time-optimise the approach?

Focused on python because I had taken one intro Javascript class in undergrad so it made more sense to me than R.

Lots of online video learning, working on (read: failing) projects of my own, and volunteering extra hours to DS efforts at work.

Found current job on LinkedIn, they liked the initiative that I had shown and I interviewed really well, was able to talk a lot about my personal projects and things I had volunteered for at work.

6349,d6wgmp,"I attended a bootcamp career day through work, and these are my thoughts.",,"I come from a traditional background (B.S. in Math/Econ, M.S. in Statistics) before starting my first DS job and like many of my other peers, have looked down upon the structure of boot camps. Recently through work I was invited to attend a career day where 20 new bootcamp grads presented their capstone project. I went with the goal of possibly opening up my viewpoint on bootcamps, and here are ultimately my thoughts.

**There are some bootcamp people who have very advanced degrees, and are using it to bridge the gap between academia and industry.**

Out of 20 people, 3 had a M.S. and 2 had a PhD. I definitely noticed a more thorough approach in their capstone projects (i.e. carefully deciding on which models to use, understanding their data, understanding model outputs, and effortlessly conveying to the audience what their results produced.) These were definitely the strongest projects, and with their knowledge in academia plus skills like Python, AWS, etc. taught in the bootcamp will most likely land jobs.

**There seems to be a large disconnect between what Data Science is in a bootcamp and Data Science in real life.**

15/20 projects involved Computer Vision, Audio/Image Processing, or NLP. Nearly everyone used pre-trained deep neural nets, word2vec, etc. and just applied their own datasets (often Kaggle sets) and nonsensically add/removed layers to fine tune their model results. Most of the presentations revolved around if their results were cool or not, and this is a very dangerous approach to DS, as:

* You will most likely not be doing deep learning after your bootcamp. This sets an unrealistic goal.
* Some fed their neural nets completely biased datasets, and it was clear that the results were biased as well and they did not realize this
* It was clear that some people did not understand how they work at all, and were just interested in the results and applications. This leads me to:

**The fundamentals of Machine Learning and Statistics seemed to be ignored**

Nearly all of the bachelors level presentations used extremely clean datasets from Kaggle and were essentially cookie cutter projects based off of each other. There was almost no discussion on understanding feature relationships, feature engineering, feature importance, missing value imputation, bias, etc. (the few that did do it stood out to me very well.) Everyone jumped to the strongest models first (deep neural nets, XGBoost) without trying simpler ones to see if it would solve their question. 

All in all, I can see why bootcamps have their appeal (why do a 2 year MS or a 4-6 year PhD when I can land a job in 12 weeks?) and I do believe that they could land jobs in certain places (such as roles that are glorified analysts, basic data engineering, or the modeling is cookie cutter.) However in an environment where businesses are trying to solve unique and tough problems that highly impacts the business, a bootcamper may fail as they don't have the sound fundamentals as someone who has spent years studying the field of ML.

It forces you to think about things in the most efficient way possible and find solutions which are not obvious at first.

It's a lot of fun seeing how your algorithm compares to others and learning ways which your algorithm can be improved. 

I was just wondering if something similar to this exists for machine learning specifically?

6359,bd7ah3,Trilogy Bootcamps - A Warning,,"TL;DR: Trilogy Education Bootcamps are a scam. If you're considering a bootcamp, and it's partnered with a university, check if it's hosted by Trilogy before enrolling. If it is, stay away.

Hi all,

Just wanted to write a quick cautionary post for anyone considering bootcamps as a potential route for getting into the data science field.

I‚Äôm a recent graduate with an MS in applied math in December looking for positions as a data analyst / scientist. Unfortunately, I wasn't having much luck getting responses. I didn't have any previous internships, as my original plan was to get a PhD, and only ended up getting the MS due to major problems with the school that cropped up halfway through my third semester (a whole other story, though). I had seen a few recommendations for bootcamps on here as a way to break into the field for people with no experience. I noticed that my undergraduate school ""hosted"" one, and figured that it might be a good way to fill in the gap between me graduating and me finally getting a job, and at the very least learn how to implement all of the theory that I had been learning over my degrees. I had some experience in Python from undergrad and from going through some Kaggle tutorials, but figured there had to be something else I was missing since I wasn't getting any responses.

After enrolling and paying (way too much) money, I got to the class and learned pretty quickly that the bootcamp wasn't hosted by the university, but rather some company called Trilogy Education Services. Already I felt uneasy about continuing, but figured since I already paid I should stick with it. As the class continued, however, I quickly realized that I had essentially been swindled.

Enrollment: When I submitted my email / cell number for an ""I'm interested, tell me more"" link, I started to get daily calls from some employee of Trilogy who I thought was working for the university they were partnered with. Looking back, they were definitely trying to bait me into signing up for the class as soon as possible. There was an entrance exam, meant to screen people out, which was an absolute joke and that I wouldn't be surprised if no one actually does get screened. Some of the golden lines were ""we only have one spot left, and there's a few people I'm talking to that are considering it"" and ""I can't tell you which companies we have at the career days, like if I told you it was <massive company with ties to my city> and they weren't there, you'd be disappointed, but if you knew which companies we were partnered with, you'd be excited"" (these exact lines were also told to my classmates, too!). Red flags were going off at this point for me, but I was scared about having a gap on my resume where I wasn't doing anything, so I ended up taking the bait. Once I finally to the class, after paying, I learned that it was Trilogy hosting the class, and not the university.

Curriculum: All over the place. It's obvious that they come from a webdev bootcamp background. So far it's been: 2 weeks of Excel / VBA, 6 weeks of Python (this should be the meat of the course, but everything we covered was so basic that I had already covered it between the single class I had taken and Kaggle tutorials), some relational database stuff (I hadn't even taken a class on this and I knew 90% of the stuff they taught just from spending a week or two on hackerrank SQL questions...), HTML / CSS website building (boiled down to copy and pasting lines of bootstrap code), a few random other topics like nonrelational databases (explained poorly, I still don't know when you'd use a relational vs nonrelational other than when you really want joins), some statistics / hypothesis testing (explained very incorrectly), and web scraping with beautifulsoup / splinter (surprisingly decent, though I knew BS beforehand). Next week we're going into JS, which‚Ä¶ why‚Ä¶ It feels like everything we're learning is solely for visualizing data, when I signed up for the bootcamp (and expressed to the recruiter person) that I was seeking to become a data scientist. We were told that it was a project based curriculum to help better our portfolio, but none of the projects we've done I'd feel comfortable pinning on my GitHub or listing on my resume.

Support staff: The instructor... is a nice guy, but god awful at teaching. Incredibly basic concepts that even I could talk about would be explained in the most convoluted way possible that would leave everyone confused. Every single time a student asks a question, he fails to understand the meat of what they're asking and starts going off on some long tangent talking about stuff that isn't relevant to what they asked. He also is horrible at keeping pace with the class, and we will very often fall behind to the point where some assignments simply aren't covered or are explained during extra hours that he tacks on before class. Additionally, I feel sometimes like he just doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. I remember a specific time that the person sitting next to me asked him a pretty simple question (which should have been answered in the solutions to the assignment we were doing), and the instructor proceeded to go into a 10 minute tangent trying to figure out what to do, before I finally leaned over and answered her question in a sentence. I remember when we were discussing hypothesis testing that the instructor, in one day, attempted to: accept the null hypothesis, accept the alternative hypothesis, thought that a p-value of 0.5 was the usual threshold of significance (he said this multiple times, even after being corrected), and thought that we had a p-value of ~6.38 on one problem because he didn't understand what the e-05 at the end of the number meant (and seemed to still not get it after another student explained scientific notation to him).

~~The TAs don't do anything. We had one good one who stopped participating after a couple months due to schedule overload, and after he left I don't think a TA has talked to me or asked me how I was doing on the assignments more than one or two times since. Other classmates have the same complaints. Instead, all they do is sit in the back and talk loudly to each other while the instructor is attempting to teach.~~ (see edit: I was being too harsh on them. They're doing their best, and honestly are the best part of the class) 

There's a ""student success manager"" in charge of some behind the scenes of the class that also doesn't seem to do anything. We have weekly reviews that are submitted of how we're feeling about the class, and after I finally submitted 10 or so poor - mediocre reviews she emailed me asking what she can do to help, and after giving a response of my grievances I was met with silence. Career services so far has been useless. All we've done halfway through the class is develop a brand statement (elevator speech) and submitted our resume for review (my comments boiled down to put the bootcamp at the top of the resume and take out any academic achievements I had like my published paper, which... why...) or given information documents with stuff that seems blatantly wrong (We were given a document of skill clusters for different jobs, and I may be wrong here, but I don't think Hadoop is the 3rd most important skill a data scientist should have).

Companies Trilogy is *actually* partnered with: The previous session of the bootcamp that was hosted at the same location had their career day during one of our classes, so I got to see what they had to offer. And... it was maybe 10 or so tiny companies / startups I had seen on linkedin during my job hunt, and nothing from large companies that I'd like to have connections at. <massive company with ties to my city> was definitely *not* there. One of my classmates even talked to one of them and their recruiter told him that they weren't even looking for entry-level people, and were there for senior managers, which is just absolutely hilarious.

Overall, the way I feel can be summed up as: I'm paying money for the company to use me as a partial TA. Half the time I'm in the class I'm helping answer questions of my classmates and explain things to them that I understood but went over their heads. I was told by the recruiter that I'd be a good fit and bring a lot to the class, but I didn't realize it would be in the form of free labor for them.

These grievances aren't just how I'm feeling either. I was thinking that I was the one person feeling this way about the class since I came in with an advanced background and thought ""maybe I was just at a level above what this is targeting,"" but after talking to some of my classmates who came in with no background in these topics (so what this bootcamp is targeting), they all feel the exact same way as me, except instead of feeling like they're wasting their time covering what they already know, they're wasting their time having everything explained to them poorly and then will need to go back and actually learn it on their own. Which, if that's the case for everyone, then why are we paying $10k a seat for an instructor and TAs to not be helpful?

If you're considering a bootcamp that's partnered with a university, and they seem to be partnered with a fair few, please check if the bootcamp is associated or hosted by Trilogy in any way. If it is, I would highly recommend against pursuing it. People in my situation (advanced degree, slight knowledge of what goes on in DS but no experience) would be far better off simply tackling some Kaggle problems and learning this on their own. People with absolutely no knowledge of what happens in DS won't develop proper skills here, unless the only thing you wanted to do was build web dashboards, which you could probably find some online resources covering exactly this for free. After spending a few months applying, I'm finally starting to get some responses for jobs, no thanks to this bootcamp. I'm not even sure if I should be listing it on my resume, to be quite frank, because I feel like the projects I've done on my own and my degree go a lot farther.

Hopefully someone in the same position I was in gets something from this post. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Looking back I was too harsh on the TAs. I'm probably fixating on a couple of off days that they had, and during class today I noticed they were going around and answering questions a lot more than I used to notice. We also have a newer one who definitely seems to be doing quite well.

6372,bfgwvt,Insight Into Recruiting At Big Tech Company From Former Data Scientist,,"Context for what follows:  I was a Data Scientist for 4-5 years, and now I work in tech recruiting at a large tech company.  I'm recruiting for software developers specifically, but I'm guessing that my experience is relevant for Data Science as well.

I've seen several threads recently debating the merits/importance of the actual job title ""Data Scientist.""  I've commented something to the effect of: I don't think it's the most important thing in the world, but I also don't think it's meaningless.   
So I'd like to give some insight as to where I think it does and doesn't matter.

In my current role at ""large tech company,"" I source resumes from an internal database based on whatever logic my imagination can come up with.  I might choose to search for ""software developer"" or I might choose to search for ""java OR c++ OR scalability OR service oriented architecture"" - in other words, I can search for job titles if I want, or I can search for key words / skillsets.  The reality is that it's not lost on recruiters that job titles can be highly variable, so more often than not, we're looking for the skillsets / the keywords we expect to represent them.  So that's how we find resumes and get you into the whole coding test, phone screen, etc process.  So the next question is: how does your job title affect salary should you receive an offer?  At my company it flat out doesn't.  The salary ranges are set internally based on the job we're recruiting for.  There's room for negotiation and exceptions and all of that, but that's a conversation that happens so far down the line that the real technical folks already have a good understanding of who you are.  So I can say with confidence that: 1) recruiters know there is variability in job titles, but usually have a more specific idea of what skills they're looking for and adjust their strategies accordingly, and 2) it really doesn't affect your salary if you're hired.  So in the context of a large tech company with recruiters sourcing for candidates, the job title is not that important.  If you don't have the actual job title ""Data Scientist"" then just make sure that you write ""Data Science"" somewhere on your resume just in case.

Now let me tell you where I think the job title might actually matter: at smaller companies that don't have sophisticated recruiting operations.  I've worked at a start up where literally the founder of the company found me on LinkedIn directly. And I can almost guarantee that he found me simply by searching for ""Data Science + <city>.""  Now, it's possible that in those search results he found people with the actual job title ""Data Scientist"" but also people who just have Data Science mentioned in their profile.  It's hard to say what heuristics he used to filter down those results, but I have to imagine this is something that really changes on a case to case basis.  If I'm looking to hire someone, questions I might ask myself are - do I need an experienced Data Scientist? can I just train an aspiring Data Scientist instead?  All of those types of considerations affect what someone looking to hire for a Data Science role is going to do and there are too many possibilities to generalize on the importance or lack thereof of the title.  The answer is definitely maybe!

The last consideration that I'd like to address is how the job title pertains to perceptions of career progression and seniority.  That's definitely something recruiters look for when they're hiring for non entry level positions.  But from my experience so far, I think that if you have the appropriate years of relevant experience, an odd looking career progression might get noticed and asked about later on, but I think it's less likely to be used as a reason to screen you out early in the process.  

I could go an ad nauseam, but I think I'll just end this here.  I hope this helps people at least a little.",,179,datascience
6373,b0mpnj,"Machine Learning Resume Generator With Python, TextGenRnn and AWS",,"I was like one of you folks once, trying to think how to write a resume before I started working as a full-stack dev at a place I love. Over the years I have obsessed about how to make it easy for every one to build their resume. Using some AI magic, I ended up creating a site (a side project) that allows you to create a resume for free. Here‚Äôs the link: [https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/](https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/)

I've used [https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn) to generate the text by feeding it data scraped from various resources. My script runs in a ""while true"" loop and generates a new resume every 3-4 seconds. Resume is then saved to S3 and the same resume is loaded via CloudFront for all users.

I plan to make it more and more awesome, like you add your name and designation and it fills up your resume. But, I thought it would be nice to get a feedback from you folks and see if I can add the to my to-do for the side project.

I‚Äôd the following thoughts on why I started working on it:

\- I knew a guy who got a job at Google, who previously couldn‚Äôt get a job at an IT agency just cause his resume wasn‚Äôt good enough

\- Not all of us have the skills required to write creatively and organize it. That doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt qualify for a job

Things like these are weirdly still a hurdle for many (it is going to be 2020 next year!). I want them not to be a hurdle anymore :slightly\_smiling\_face:

So, pitchfork me if you hate what I built, but if you loved it or have any suggestions do share your thoughts with me. Appreciation will make my day, critique will help me shape it.

6375,f6pnmc,Why Some Companies Want Their Data Scientists to be Good Engineers,,"There have been several posts lately about the apparently growing trend for data scientist jobs to have engineering requirements. Most of the explanations are some combination of:

* assuming job description does not match actual role
* different job types being lumped into ""data scientist"" title
* assuming companies don't know what they're doing or doing things ""wrong""

Those things are probably happening to some degree. But there some very valid reasons for companies to want people who marry data scientist and engineer skills, which I don't really see being given much coverage in these discussions, so I would like to cover some of them.

Even if you disagree with the reasons, you should be aware that these positions are lucrative, and in my opinion, do interesting work, so it might make sense to understand what these positions are and why they have the requirements they do.

A growing number of companies have products which rely on making recommendations or decisions at scale and rely on ML to make those decisions. It's a critical business need for the systems to be robust. However, experimentation and iteration are key components of data science, so systems must also be adaptable. I hope it's obvious that building a robust, yet adaptable system is a hard engineering challenge.

You might wonder why it is the realm of data scientists and not of data engineers and machine learning engineers to work on such a system. The answer is it is the realm of all three. Data engineers and machine learning engineers will own certain core components and data scientists will own certain modules.

An example might be that the data engineering team owns a system that performs ETL, but a data scientist might implement a transformation to calculate a specific feature or metric that is then run within the ETL system to produce the feature on a regular basis. If the data scientist is owning the actual transform, then she likely takes into account computational complexity when designing the feature, has verified the code produces the expected output, and is not blocked by another team's planning / priorities.

Another example is that as decision making systems evolve, their complexities grow. A simple system might use an ML model and make some decision based on a threshold, i.e. choose a point on the ROC. I'm not sure this case is very common in practice. More complex systems have multiple available actions and rely on the outputs of multiple models. Evolutions of these systems might come from increasing the size of the action space or increasing the number of different models in use. It is usually data scientists who are proposing, designing, and testing these evolutions. Designs to be cognizant of engineering challenges - it is very wasteful to design and build something that cannot be used in practice. On the other hand, it is very difficult for engineers to build something they do not understand.

Even something as simple as training a model cannot be divorced from engineering realities. Large scale systems have latency and memory constraints. The freedom that is present during model explorations to include new features or try new model architecture is generally at odds with these constraints. New ideas that cannot be implemented in the production system are wasted, so data scientists have to have a strong understanding of how those constraints affect their models.

So if I were to try to list the key arguments I would probably go with:

* Coordination costs between teams are very high, so enabling data scientists to put their work directly into production makes iteration a lot faster
* Incorporating an understanding of production constraints into the design of new ideas means that execution will be much smoother
* Keeping context of the details of the production system allows the data scientist to make more accurate assessments of what changes will have the highest impact

Which data science paradigm is right for a given company clearly depends on a number of factors, including company size, the extent to which ML is critical to the business, variety of ML products within the company, etc. My impression is that, at least in the tech industry, the data scientist with engineering expertise paradigm is taking hold across a pretty large range of company sizes, with only the very large and very small sticking with the data scientists who are doing very little engineering work.",,173,datascience

Hey, I'm halfway through the writing of my new book, so I wanted to share that fact and also invite volunteers to help me with the quality. Similarly to [my previous book](http://themlbook.com/), the new book will be distributed on the ""read first, buy later"" principle, when the entire text will remain available online and ""to buy or not to buy"" will be left on the reader's discretion. Thanks to the help of volunteers, my previous book was greatly improved, so I hope for the same for my new book.

The Machine Learning Engineering book will not contain descriptions of any machine learning algorithm or model. It will be entirely devoted to the engineering aspects of implementing a machine learning project, from data collection to model deployment and monitoring. Five chapters are already online and available from the book's [companion website](http://www.mlebook.com/).

I hope to get a ton of feedback from this community. If something is not entirely correct or plain wrong, please don't hesitate to tell me. The best way to leave comments in a specific chapter is by using dropbox's built-in document commenting feature. (Each chapter is a PDF shared on dropbox.)

I understand that there are a multitude of posts regarding how to break into Data Science (DS) without a CS degree or PhD; however, I haven't seen one discussing what non-CS, non-PhD Data Scientist do once they're one in terms of career prospects. I hope this post will allow those type of people to share their experiences.

I‚Äôm a new age Product/Analytics Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but limited data engineering and no production-level ML). Having worked for several months, I have become keenly aware of several things about myself:

1. I lack the CS background required to become a Data Engineer (setting up data lakes from scratch; ETL automation; deploying a ML model to production);
2. I lack the PhD background and also do not enjoy the high-level mathematics that will be required to become a ML Engineer (building and optimising cutting-edge algorithms);
3. I lack the economics/finance background to become an DS Economist (focusing on econometrics).

In short, due to my background, I feel like I‚Äôm a half-baked DS who can only remain as a Product/Analyst DS, unless I put a ludicrous amount of time and effort to overcome my (MSc in structural engineering) background and specialise. Similarly, it‚Äôll be very difficult for me to become a non-specialised ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù DS which is highly sought in small-midscale startups. I‚Äôve also been told that DS Managers who lack technical/specialised expertise are unable to climb far in the management career ladder (say Head of Data), which means just remaining in my current position will likely be a bad move in the long term.

&#x200B;

2017 June. I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience, a publication in data vis, and a physics/math bachelors who spends a lot of time reading books and studying math, physics, and computer science. I pretty much self taught myself enough programming to make a great income, but spent a lot of time thinking I might be interested in a research role at a company not necessarily working on product and being a slave to release cycles. In my self teaching, I've pretty much went through SICP, Cormen, an Automata Book, ISL, Casella and Berger, and even an analysis of algorithms using combinatorics. I'm not a big fan of R so I learn enough python to get by, but don't deep dive because I already have a healthy full-stack dev job in javascript land where I get paid a ton making web apps that are just wrappers for prediction algorithms. Yet every interview no one would take me seriously in interviews to jump onto a team because of ""lack of experience in the field"". Completely open-ended and ambiguous questions using technologies I don't use in my day to day would hang me up every time. SQL optimization? Some obscure function closure in R? I'd get asked it and drop the ball on an interview. By the way, I also get vetted by software engineers and marketing teams. ""You don't know Google AdWords?"" Mind you these interviews are offering almost $20K less than what I make now, because I don't fall into the ""experienced"" category of job applicants and I'm ""entry level"". So I get an idea, since I'm reading all this stuff and I feel like I know enough to get by:

&#x200B;

Let's do a data science masters!

&#x200B;

My experience is as follows:

&#x200B;

A pre-requisite class introductory programming in Java because as a physics/math major with 5 years of experience, granted in javascript, cannot possibly learn how to program. It's super fun to spend $4k to learn a type system in Java that I already know since I've used Haskell. Lovely.

&#x200B;

Second class, masters level algorithms class which is the first actual class in the program Useful, but we're just going over Cormen et. al. Which I already read. Another $4K down the drain. By the way, my employer isn't paying for this so this is my cash. Granted there was some stuff I glanced over in the first reading like bipartite graph algorithms and getting an idea of max flow, but the rest of the class was cut and dry simple. Mind you I'm paying $4k to fill a hole in my knowledge that could be filled with a Medium post.

&#x200B;

Third Class, masters level statistics class. Useful, but we're just going over the stuff in Casella and Berger. A useful but expensive rehash of all the flavors of distributions and hypothesis testing for all of them. Another $4k down the drain.

&#x200B;

I'm done. My next class would be a review of ISL. Do I need another expensive hand-holding through a book I already read? Shall we discuss confusion matrices and how to construct trees for another $4k? I'm just not doing it. The other set of classes are in databases and optimization. I can read that stuff on my own. There would have been a total of 10 classes at $4K each, so I'm just not setting myself back $40K to apply to jobs that I'll be underqualified for anyways.

&#x200B;

What I've learned:

&#x200B;

Since then I got a job at a business that focuses on being a tool for data scientists so we have then on-staff as well as sell directly to data science teams, where I do full-stack engineering building the product as a software engineer who knows enough stats + data science to build the product. I'm learning that right now data scientist jobs are gatekept, and rightly so, by people who are spending a lot of money on people who are arguably not generating anything on their bottom lines. These stakeholders were already sold on the data-lake ROI that returned nothing, so they're extremely hesitant to invest more in resources in a tech buzz that probably won't actually give them ROI. Keep in mind many of these business don't have any existing resources to get make data scientists productive. It's not alien for data scientists to be hired and they just get pointed to a PostGRES database on AWS, and told ""Here you go."" The standards for getting hired are extremely high in many positions because they simply can't afford a false-positive hire. Keep in mind they don't know what they want anyways, as evidenced by plenty of stories of data scientists who did get jobs but quickly realized they're a one-man show of smoke and mirrors. Companies want to integrate data science into their strategy to remain competitive, but they have no idea what that means for their business. I've learned no to join this rat race. There are plenty of problems for smart people to work on, and data science doesn't need me. 90% of people are using the technologies to detect smiles, and the other 5% credit loan processing, and 5% marketing. I want to do none of these things. I specifically wanted to join a field where I could use more of my mathematics in my day to day, but I'm not willing to sacrifice more cash and an already well founded career for that. As an experienced software developer I make more than an entry level data scientist, whatever that even means since you need a graduate degree to really get your resume looked at. By the way, even with a graduate degree, you better have industry experience or else you'll get bounced by a marketing or finance person in your data science interview, or worse: low-balled.

6407,b41egp,How to get an internship in 2019,,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here‚Äôs a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - ‚Äúfriends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don‚Äôt send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples‚Äô work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you‚Äôll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person‚Äôs name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I‚Äôm an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I‚Äôm reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they‚Äôve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don‚Äôt respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you‚Äôve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them ‚ÄúHow can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?‚Äù, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you‚Äôd be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn‚Äôt absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you‚Äôve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won‚Äôt make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you‚Äôve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you‚Äôre ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There‚Äôs a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you‚Äôre not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That‚Äôs what will ultimately start you on your journey.",,157,datascience

A model is a good model if it has sufficient accuracy/precision/auroc/{insert metric here} on validation data, and I don't care if it's statistically valid or not.

I'm toying with the idea for a few of reasons:


1. The ""data science"" at my company devolved into more analytics than anything else. I've had to continue take courses outside of work to keep the actual data science skills fresh (stats, machine learning, deep learning) but barely get to apply them and it's a real bummer. At this point, I'm sure it'll be pretty hard to get into a ""real"" data science job if I try to transition. Though it seems that data science roles are becoming more product/marketing analytics which isn't too exciting, and I don't think I'm smart enough for the hardcore phd-level research scientist roles


2. I've had a lot of exposure to the data engineering side. ETLs, AWS infra, version control, various APIs, unit testing, pushing things to production, etc. and I find the process of building something from scratch and collaborating with the data engineers really fun


3. I want to be more on the back end and middle of the data spectrum. Pure modeling and analytics is the front-end, and I feel that only very mature companies have the infrastructure set up correctly for data science to be able to unlock its true potential. More job opportunities in the back end/middle for startup and growth stage companies, which i've been liking so far


4. As far as skill combinations go, software engineer + data guy seems like a pretty deadly combo for future success


What's the best process to go about this? I'd consider myself decent at leetcode-easy problems and have a very basic understanding of cs fundamentals. Not sure if I should focus on leetcode, or building a complete application to showcase, or pick up another language (I'm 99% python, 1% Scala and JavaScript), or just edit my resume to highlight the engineering side of things and pray n' spray?

6444,f3jspf,Why do you want to be a data scientist?,,"This is a question mainly for people who want to be data scientists but don't work or study currently in a related field.

Now, I want to encourage everyone who wants to be a data scientist to work hard at it, but I do worry that some people have romanticised expectations of what the role may involve, & unrealistic understanding of the combination of educational attainment, variety of skills, & practical experience that many data science roles require.

So I am curious, what is the attraction of being a data scientist for any of you who currently aren't?",,151,datascience
6445,d0izh7,Am I too slow or the expectations my manager has are unrealistic?,,"I work at a marketing firm as a data analyst who sometimes does machine learning. Very hesitantly I call myself a data scientist, for the lack of a better word. That term is used very loosely these days. Anyways.

The work is typically like doing some EDA, running simulations for loyalty programs, doing some regression analysis, sometimes doing segmentation on customers using basic SQL/Pandas queries (occasionally using ML techniques), coming up with algorithms for lead scoring, etc.

I have to constantly switch between requirements, tasks are assigned verbally or over email, there's no tracking system in place.

The people I have to deal with don't seem to appreciate that it takes time and effort to write code, generate insights, verify the results, present them in a format that non-tech sales people will understand. Besides, as in any analytics/ML project, the first approach we try seldom works. Data science is as much an iterative process as software development is IMHO. Not to mention that data is never available in a clean format. I have to spend a lot of time cleaning it before I can use it for producing results.

Usually, I get a problem statement at time t, and at t+24 hours, I'm asked for results. I find this difficult to cope with. I come from a software engineering background, where I was used to working on one problem at a time. Nobody expects daily deliverables in a software dev job (at least at no good company again IMHO). Because quality work takes time. There are times when you just don't hit your zone and get stuck at seemingly trivial problems. You need breaks, you need time to relax.

My company doesn't seem to understand this. They are mostly sales/business people who just expect ""decks"" (powerpoint presentations). They have no idea what kind of effort goes into real data science projects.

I have tried to discuss this with my manager that the deadlines are too near and too frequent. Data analytics is not a one day job. But he thinks I have a very pessimistic attitude. I was aghast after hearing that from him.

Am I just too slow for my job? I'm seriously contemplating switching to a new company. I'd like to know what kind of deadlines you guys have at work.",,153,datascience

6499,7ex1gu,Introduction to Data Science,,"**Why?**
 
Data is the closest thing we have to a real world application of truth, and the world is a better place when decisions are made with care. 

Now that you know why you should become a data scientist, here is a simple guide to becoming one. 

**Prerequisites:**

**Math**: You can honestly get really far with little math. That being said, there are far too many people who don't understand the math and end up using analysis techniques with little forethought into why they should be using that model. I will say this much: The more math, the better off you are. It is a beautiful field and directly relevant to you if you want to make the most of your foray into data science. 

Beginner: High school algebra, maybe some calculus 1, high school statistics

Intermediate: College stats, Calc 1,2,3, Probability Theory, linear algebra, Statistical Inference

Advanced: Upper undergrad / Grad level statistical inference, bayesian inference, harder probability theory, linear optimization, convex optimization, real analysis, calculus of variations. Math is the limiting factor, remove those obstacles. Learn all the advanced math you can muster.

Reccs: khanacademy if you've never seen the content. MIT OCW has really great self paced math courses for calc 1-3, linear algebra and much more. Eventually you will want to learn the art of grinding through math textbooks while doing problems. **The only way to learn math is by doing math. Practice, practice, practice.**

If you want to be a true OG, here is Michael I. Jordan's reading list for prospective grad students in ML: 

[Mike I. Jordan ML Books](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1055389)

**Programming**

Pick up a language and stick with it for now. It is far easier to pick up a second language once you are very good at one than it is to slowly work through being mediocre at a bunch of languages. 

People live and die by their language of choice for some reason. Generally, my thoughts on this are the following:

R is fantastic. R is great for data analysis, and if you use the tidyverse, R is great for everything else too. R is an **organically grown** language that is not always lexically consistent, so it can be a bit quirky. Due to the community of statistics researchers that use R, generally you will find the most bleeding edge packages on R. R will make you think like a statistician.

Python is great for taking your data a bit farther. It has packages which provide most of the functionality you would need from R. Python is a great choice because it has many more varied packages and capabilities related to software development. Python is a broad, general purpose language that is beautifully **designed** and consistent. This will make you think more like a programmer.

Over a career, it is wise to know as many tools well as you can. Since you will spend a good amount of time writing code, you should strive to learn both at some point. 

Alrighty, now onto the core stuff. 

**How to:**

**1. Get Data**

This can be done by scraping, downloading a data set, building a data set, making a survey, whatever. There is a lot of data floating around and there are plenty of resources for learning how to scrape. Since data is usually stored in data bases in the real world, it is wise to learn a bit about data bases. Learn some SQL. Since we live in the age of big data, it would also be wise to learn non-relational database query languages like nosql and postgresql

Some good spots for data: /r/datasets, kaggle, data.gov

**2. Clean it**

Remember: garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data is the foundation of all your work from here on out. Check out a book or a course that will take you from these early stages into actually playing with the data. For python, [Harvard CS109](https://github.com/cs109/content) does this. It also have video lectures. For R, Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) has a bunch of amazing books out. Check out [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511408512&sr=8-1&keywords=r+for+data+science) . It wouldn't hurt to eventually read a book on data cleaning and data interpolation.

**3. Take some time to familiarize yourself with your data**

What kind of variables are there? Quantitative (numbers)? Categorical / Qualitative (Labels)? Text? Images?
 Geographical? The types of data present will determine what can be modeled. 

Its a good idea to look at the data in list form and plot it out using R or python or excel or whatever. If using other types of data (eg images, geographical), then find the best ways to visualize the data. Now would be a good time to learn about knitr and rmarkdown if using R and jupyter notebooks if using python. 

This is the time to do some *descriptive statistics.* Look at the way the data flows on the plots. What relationships do you think are there? Are there any outliers? Plot, plot, plot, and plot some more. Make the plots look good. Check out ggplot2 in R or matplotlib / seaborn in python. 

Learn to dissect your data. Check out feature engineering. Learn to combine data sets to expand what can be done.

If you want to be a true OG, learn some graphic design principles. Learn to use blank space and color. There is nothing more influential than a beautiful graph.

A book on seaborn / matplotlib if using python. 

**4. Figure out the questions you want to ask**

This is perhaps the hardest part. The questions you ask will determine what you find in the data. When thinking about questions, ponder proactively about what techniques you would use to answer them. This is where a broad set of modeling tools comes handy. That will be gone over in the next section.

**5. Analysis**

The most satisfying part in my opinion. When you wrote out your questions, hopefully you have some idea of what techniques you would use. That said, there are a lot of techniques to choose from and each technique has its own special niches. You will learn to select models properly from seeing a lot of data and practicing. Like everything else, practice, practice, practice. Try many models, run them on test sets using cross validation and see what works best. Learn about bias-variance trade-off. 

Generally statistical analysis is broken into 2 parts: 

In descriptive statistics we want to describe the patterns and structure of the data. If you did part 3 well, this will be partially taken care of. You can expand on this as the analysis comes along. 

In inferential statistics we want to predict from the data. This is what we are at now. 

Broadly speaking, this is the content that seems to be spread around the most. I will post some reccs to different courses / books that you will see floating around this subreddit (because they are great).

**Make sure you learn and understand cross validation extremely well.**

**Make sure to understand the assumptions behind each modeling technique you use. There is no one size fits all technique.** 

Since this is such a broad topic, go learn data analysis from books and courses. Learn models, figure out why you would want to use them, and then apply them. 

Once you have completed your modeling, make sure to create a visualization. If others will be seeing it, learn to explain things in simple terms as if non experts will see it. When you are being paid to be a data scientist, it is not about how intelligent you come across, it is about results and understanding for everyone.

**6. The Great Beyond**

After step 5, you are essentially a (good) data analyst. What will differentiate you now will be the extras. Heres some other stuff that you should probably look into: 

* Databases: SQL / Nosql / any query language really. 

* Data Engineering: Create pipelines and automate a lot of the legwork to make raw data usable. 

* Shell: Linux is cool, and bash scripting is useful

* Hadoop, Mapreduce, Spark, AWS, etc: Big Data

* Deep Learning : See what the hype is all about

* Time series analysis: Given the ubiquity of time series data, a book on TSA can't hurt

* Computer Science: Learn CS rigorously. Check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, CLRS Algorithms, Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming, and more. If you learn the concepts underlying the technologies you see, you won't be outdated nearly as easily. Tools may change, but the concepts and math stay the same. 

* Learn to love practicing. This list is daunting, but it is completely achievable one small step at a time. Setting aside time to learn and practice daily will get you farther than you could ever imagine. 



**Guide to Learning**

Like all other things in life, there are exciting things and less exciting things. What you find exciting is unique to you, but for the sake of this guide I will give how I would learn the content (assuming you know basic maths and programming): 

* Learn some data analysis. If using python, think stats is nice. If using R, R for Data Science is nice
* Learn how to clean and dissect data. If you read one of the books in the bullet above, you will have learned this.
* Now learn some visualization. Make it pretty with a book on ggplot or seaborn/matplotlib
* Now learn some better tools for analysis: Read and work through Intro to Statistical Learning or Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. Ideally you would do both. 
* Learn database query languages. You will come across databases, so its best to be a wizard with them. 
* Learn hadoop / map reduce / spark for big data
* Learn the theory on a deeper level. [Probability Theory](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) is great, Statistical Inference is great, Bayesian Inference and multilevel modeling is great. 
* Never stop learning

6504,au2u0h,Crowdsourcing the top skillset to become a decent data scientist/analyst.,,"I have read with great interest on this thread, especially (this thread)\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ats06d/im\_a\_data\_scientist\_starterpack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ats06d/im_a_data_scientist_starterpack/)\], as we all seem to have different perspectives on what constitutes a data scientist, and what core skills, so I thought I'd try something, which is to crowdsource a collective view within this subreddit of the key skillsets required.

&#x200B;

Approach:

1. I will start off by posting top level comments as generic skill sets that are either business, technical, statistics and mathematics related.
2. Upvote the ones you believe are important core skill sets, but DO NOT downvote any other skills if you disagree/don't know is key. If you don't agree with a skill set not being core, simply don't upvote.
3. Leave your comments as second level comments so the top comments are always relating to the skills in question.
4. Add skills you think are important but you don't find them in top level comments.
5. By the end of the whole exercise, with enough votes, I believe we should then be able to see our crowdsourced key skills for this profession that are sought after and are important to being a good data scientist/analyst (note: my methodology may have loopholes, so please feel free to suggest some changes, I have a research methodology and statistics background but don't profess to be an expert, so comments welcomed)

The whole article stands apart from the usual, self-promoted data science management articles I come across. The author reviews six common team models:

> __The Center-of-Excellence Model__

> Let‚Äôs start with the most centralized of all models. In the center-of-excellence (CoE) model, also known as the research model, the expectation is that the data science team would work independently to identify big bets and build prototypes. Under this model, the data science team is considered to be the company‚Äôs innovation arm.

> __The Accounting Model__

> In the accounting model, also known as the BI model, the data science team would produce reports and presentations on a recurring basis (usually monthly and quarterly). The data science team would inform the organization of notable movements in top-level metrics. Once the team identifies an interesting trend, they would work with product teams to investigate the root cause. Thus, quite frequently, playing detective becomes a main part of the data science team under the accounting model.

> __The Consultant Model__

> In the consultant model, the data science team is assigned tickets or emailed with questions. Data science managers then prioritize the tickets and questions and assign them to data scientists.

> __The Embedded Model__

> In this model, product teams hire their own data scientists. Each engineering manager is in charge of planning for data scientist headcount, hiring, and allocation. The data scientist within each product team has the engineering team members as their peers.

> __The Democratic Model__

> In this model, it is believed that easy and straightforward access to data by product managers, designers, engineering managers, and engineers would lessen or remove the need for a data science role. Many identify the main need for hiring data scientists to be the lack of proper infrastructure for fast and easy dashboard creation.

> __The Product Data Science Model__

> Between the extremes of the fully centralized model (the CoE model) and the fully decentralized model (the embedded model), there exists a spectrum of hybrid models that take certain characteristics from each of the aforementioned models. Taking advantage of the strengths of both models, while actively making up for their deficiencies is what makes hybrid models successful.

> The product data science (PDS) model is inspired, in part, by the matrix structure. In this model, individuals are simultaneously part of the data science function and the product. Data scientists, each a member of a product team, report into a central data science team.

6515,5rvxqf,The confusing messages about the data science career,,"Speaking as someone with a PhD in a quantitative field who'd like to become a data scientist (at least, I think I'd like to do that), it has been a challenge to figure out what the data science career is all about and especially how to get into it. I think I'm a pretty smart, discerning person, but the things I've read and heard about this career are, as a whole, so confusing and so contradictory it's hard to know what to think.

Several months ago, after doing some research, I thought this was a viable path for me and that I had a plan to get into the field. Today, I don't know whether any of the things I believed about this career months ago are true, whether it's realistic for me to get a data science position in the near future, or whether this is a career I would even want.

I thought I'd list paraphrased version of some of the confusing and often contradictory things I've read and heard about this career for your amusement. If anyone has thoughts, by all means please comment, although at this point I don't think I'll believe anything anyone says about this stuff without experiencing it firsthand.

* Data science is a viable career path for people without a strong technical background who are willing to take a couple online courses.

* It's very straightforward to get a data scientist position if you have an advanced degree in any quantitative field, especially if you can code.

* It's almost impossible to get a data scientist position right out of (grad) school. No matter what field your degree was in, you probably need to spend a couple years working as a data analyst or BI person to get some domain expertise.

* Data science is a field with a serious talent shortage; companies are desperate for anyone who's at all qualified.

* The data science job market is flooded with applicants; any open job is going to get dozens if not hundreds of reasonably qualified applicants. It's really hard to get a job unless you seriously stand out. 

* The technical skills are the least important aspect. It's more important to work well with people and be a good communicator. You can easily learn the technical aspects on the job.

* A data scientist just needs to know more statistics than a programmer and more coding than a statistician.

* A data scientist needs to know all about optimization, numerical analysis, algorithms and data structures, and lots of advanced machine learning and statistics.

* The only things you really have to know are the fundamentals: be able to write some code in Python and R and know about confidence intervals and linear regression.

* In order to appeal to employers, it's crucial to have experience with the *exact technologies* the employer uses. If they use Hadoop, you must know Hadoop. Etc.

* There's no way to be a data scientist without knowing some pretty advanced math.

* Math isn't really relevant for data science in practice, and some of the most successful data scientists I know don't even know calculus.

* Data scientists spend their time working on intellectually challenging problems that are just as interesting as those in academia.

* Data scientists spend most of their time on boring data munging issues, usually with an ultimate goal of selling more shoes or some other horrible marketing thing.

* The data science field is really hot and will surely continue to grow for many years to come.

* Data science has hit its peak; it will continue to be useful in its areas of legitimate application, but companies are realizing it was oversold and they will be cutting back.

* There is an amazing amount of value to be had in data science.

* Most data scientists contribute nothing worthwhile to their employers.

* You must have a portfolio of projects to show employers.

* I don't know any data scientists with a portfolio of projects; my coworkers and I think that's a waste of time.

Here's another discouraging thing: looking at job ads for data scientist positions, there is such a crazy variety of skills and experience desired for each position. While I know that ""Required skills"" aren't always really required, it's pretty bewildering when:

* one position says you must have NLP experience;

* one says you must have cybersecurity experience;

* one says you must have Javascript and web programming experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience in the health care industry;

* one says you must have retail marketing experience;

* one says you must have bioinformatics experience;

* one says you must have experience in the intelligence community;

* one says you must have Django experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience with the Microsoft products SSMS, SSAS, and SSRS;

* one says you must know SAS;

* one says you must have experience in financial analysis.

In the above list, when I listed specific technologies, it was because they seem somewhat outside the standard data science toolkit, as far as I know. But even when they mention ""mainstream"" technologies, they vary so much between the different positions, and there is such a massive list. Different ones want AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, PostgreSQL, MySQL, D3, Tableau, MapReduce, Flink, Mahout, MongoDB, Cassandra, and many more.

Judging by the ads, there is probably hardly anyone in the world who is qualified for more than one of these positions... and yet they are all ""data scientist"" positions.

6521,ewrjpe,Warning - Tableau Prep is dangerously broken,,"So, disclaimer. This is mostly a vent from someone who works mainly with operational data and is not a hard 'Data Scientist'. If you have clean, reliable data sources your BI/IT department maintains on your behalf, your experience may be very different. **This is a warning for the other low-code Ops Data mungers and wrangles; the target audience for Tableau Prep.**

**Context**:

For those not in the know, Tableau Prep was a long teased breakout of the Data Connection interface baked into Tableau *Desktop*. Prep has been out of beta for (checks notes) about two years.

As someone who mainly relies on unclean tables from dozens of departments and third-party enterprise platforms, Tableau is uncontested IMHO for getting the shape of data needing wrangling.

I often explain my use of Tableau Desktop to being equivalent to how 90% of people use Photoshop. Sure, it's overkill. There are more powerful or specialized tools out there.

But dragging a CSV into Tableau Desktop and getting a sense of the data structure/distribution is painless. If you're so inclined, you can also build out a semi-automated workflow that connects to your db and dynamically formats visuals; it spits out pretty PDFs to emails and internal customers can view dashboards. For quick turnaround and ad-hoc reporting, it's f'ing great.

**The issue with Tableau Prep: It's not just buggy, but** ***dangerously unstable***

The [UI is slick and intuitive](https://help.tableau.com/current/prep/en-us/Img/prep_union3.png), making Unions/Joins happen in near-real time and leveraging Tableau's formulas to execute basic but powerful value manipulation. [It natively connects to pretty much any data source.](https://help.tableau.com/current/prep/en-us/Img/prep_connect.png) It spits out CSV or .hyper (Tableau packaged extracts)  cleanly. It's a more accessible version of Alteryx with the bonus of being bundled into the Tableau Server suite, taking out a bunch of overhead.

It's great! Until it's not.

Join too many sources (\~5+) in a single union and it hangs regardless of the table size. Make too many changes in a step (ex. rename 50 fields) and it hangs. Join larger tables on fields that have null values and it'll likely lock up before you can catch the issue.

Annoying? Sure, but not end of the world. **Where it's nightmare fuel is how it handles errors and low-resource warnings.**

It gives a error notification, sometimes a soft one.

Then it loops for a while.

Then, *maybe* it'll let you save. More likely, it's going to freeze out the UI while it works indefinitely.

The more changes, the more steps, the more sources you have, the more likely it's going to loop forever and lock your work away in a frozen process with no way to recover. **Half the time, force-killing the hung executable is going to corrupt Tableau Prep's tmp/log files holding the sample data it uses for staging, making earlier versions go straight to the same unrecoverable error state.** You *can* regenerate a new tmp/log files by creating a flow from scratch using 'new' data sources, but good luck recovering your existing saved steps from Prep when it's in the endless-loop state.

After speaking with some more skilled individuals, I've decided to avoid Tableau Prep and just script transformations outside of the Tableau suite entirely. SQL and Python still get the job done. Missing Prep's real-time previews it takes longer having to constantly check output samples, but I'm never at risk of losing days (or weeks) of work to one messy join statement.

**Edit:** Rereading this and some of my comments, realizing how frustrated I was while writing it.

Thanks everyone for the support, good to know I'm not crazy for going back to more manual scripting.

I stand by my statement that Tableau Prep is soul-crushingly broken.",,135,datascience

6524,5jbdpi,Data Science Challenge #1,,"I've been enjoying DailyProgrammer subreddit and I liked the 52 vis challenge while it was running so I thought I'd see if there was any interest in something similar focused on data science. The basic idea is every week post a data science-y question and have every one submit answers and vote on the best. I thought I'd post a challenge here and see what kind of response I got. If it's good, I have a few other challenges written down and I'll make a new subreddit for it.  
    
-------------------------  
Challenge #1:  
Download the following dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/tae/tae.data
Read the description here:

Clean the data and then build a predictive model (machine learning or whatever you want) to predict the class attribute variable. 
     
---------------------  
Submission Guidelines (stealing from DailyProgrammer):  
For your submission, lets us know what language you're using, the accuracy you got, then enter your code: include both the download/cleaning code and the modeling.  
Also, indent all you code parts with four spaces so other people won't immediately see your result.  
  
Have fun!

Is that enough to enter data science teams at a post-Excel company?  Or do data scientists laugh off applicants who come from Excel-centric businesses?  You know what I mean by that--we've all seen organizations that are stubbornly clinging to doing 95% of their work in Excel in 2019.

At its core, **the main problem seems to stem from the dichotomy between professional, experienced data scientists and those who aren't (yet) data scientists.**

After reading everyone's comments and discussing the issue with several other Data Scientists that had never been here before, /u/__compactsupport__ and I are prepared to make some major changes to the subreddit, if the community approves.

1. **Only flaired users can make new submissions without mod approval.**  Non-flaired users can comment on any submission, but any new submission of theirs must be approved by a moderator.

2. **Beginner questions about getting into Data Science may only be made to the ""beginner"" sticky submission.**  This can include those just starting out or those trying to change their career.  The sticky threads will be archived at some interval, which will be determined later.  An archival list will be kept for beginners to be directed towards.

3. **Additional moderators are required.** This is in order to facilitate quicker submission and user flair approval/rejection.

Furthermore, link and user flair categories will need to be updated to reflect these changes.  However, this may hold off until the new reddit site redesign is complete due to changes in how flair filtering works.

When you are learning and have a new teacher rotating basically every session, they have no idea what the instructor before them has delved into and what style they are teaching from.

A few of the teachers would literally stand up with the physically printed solved code and just read from the code while typing it back into their computer. With one teacher, the code wouldn‚Äôt work and he basically said ‚ÄòYou get the jist, but we have to move on for time‚Äôs sake...‚Äô

I would say that 80% of us also have full-time jobs.

6539,e7r2ni,"When you were a new Data Scientist, how quickly did your responsibilities increase and when did it warrant a salary increase?",,"TLDR: New fresh-grad MSc. in my first job as an Associate Data Scientist. Responsibilities grew to that of a normal Senior Data Scientist within 6 months and will double by the beginning of next year. If a promotion isn't possible, how can I make the most of my situation, whether increasing compensation, refusing too much work, etc?

Hi guys,

I'm in a bit of precarious situation and I hope you guys would be able to help. I'm a new age Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/R/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but no data engineering or production-level ML modeling). At the beginning of this year, I left academia (previously PhD. Candidate) with an MSc. in electrical engineering. I applied and was accepted into a big funded start-up (think Alibaba level). From the long interview process, I was rated as barely a Senior DS; worried that I couldn't keep up due to my lack of experience, I pushed to become an Associate DS with a salary close to a Senior DS (based on my market analysis), which was accepted.

However, in the span of 6 months, I went from working with 1 Product Manager (PM) with 1 product to 2 PMs with 3 products. Now, by end of January, due to reorgs (no layoffs though), I'm now asked to **solely** handle 6 PMs with 9 products. According to my company's DS career ladder, I'm qualified to be a Senior DS when I work with 2-3 PMs and 4+ products, and these requirements are pretty consistent with the actual responsibilities of the Senior DSs I'm friends with. However, my manager has already stated that while a promotion is ""on the table"", I likely don't have the work experience nor enough time spent in the company to be considered for a promotion yet. Promotions requires multiple levels of approval, so it isn't purely based on my manager's discretion.

If a promotion isn't possible anytime soon, is it possible to ask for a salary increase or refuse part of the increased responsibilities? My responsibilities and products has increased dramatically in terms of scale, scope, and complexity (from minor, add-on features to features handling a ton of our revenue), let alone dealing with constant stakeholder management and context switching due to the highly varied products. I want to accept the increased responsibilities, but I myself am not sure whether I can handle everything; I feel like my current limit is 5-6 products, but I did grow from struggling with 1 product to comfortably handling 3 products in 4 months. Would talking to the Head of DS department help? We have done multiple skip level meetings in the past, but not for a sensitive topic like this.

What would you do in my situation? Let me know if there's a better place to ask for advice. I think this is an appropriate place due to being relatable and maybe a question on many DS's minds, given the constant influx of new talent into the industry.

EDIT: During my salary negotiation, it was agreed upon that I would mostly be  working at local-level projects, so I was given a local salary. My MSc. is from a top 20 US university, but I work in a 3rd world country, while the headquarters is at a 1st world country; thus, my salary is 4-5x less than my headquarters counterparts. In my last quarter, I was indeed only working on 1 local product/feature. However, this quarter, I worked on 1 local and 1 regional-level product/feature. I needed to fly to the headquarters cross-country at least once  a week per month. Now, by the end of January, they'll be expecting me to work on 1 local and 8 regional products/features. I'll likely need to fly over at least 2 weeks per month to maintain my quality/speed of work and for effective stakeholder management. Thus, there's also a local vs regional component to my issue.",,133,datascience

6548,c8pxq1,"If you‚Äôre about to go to college, try to go to a college that does Data science/engineering co-op internships with various companies.",,"There are a lot of schools out there that offer this and I strongly recommend this approach over going to a big name university that doesn‚Äôt have co-op programs.

Why co-op programs? 

Work experience- employers prize work experience over so many things. You obviously need to be very thorough in your machine learning and data science concepts but even getting the equivalent of two years work experience through co-ops while in school goes a long way. Employers notice your application over other candidates and they might give you a salary bump because of the work experience. 

Also working in the real world is so different than school that it gives you a trial and error chance to learn about various company cultures . 


Money- yep college/university is very expensive and it helps you at least reduce the amount of debt you need to finance school

6549,9b581v,"My neural network is 99% accurate, and 100% useless",,"Hi all, working through my first neural network side project. I'm trying to predict which P2P borrowers will default/charge off a loan. 

In the first iteration, I used only my own investment data to create a binary classification of those who paid back their loans (0) and those who defaulted (1). The problem lies in the ratio of available data: 99% of people paid, and 1% defaulted. So the NN has learned to predict that 100% of people will pay their loans and can still report 99% accuracy.

I found a much bigger data set (about 850k items vs. my original 4k) with the hope that throwing more data at the model might help. Unfortunately, the overall ratio is the same: 99% paid and 1% defaulted. This results in the same inaccurate prediction.

So experts, can you share any advice on how to approach this kind of problem? I was wondering if it's a logical approach to alter the ratio of the training set, i.e. use less of the data overall so that 1% becomes 25%. Alternatively, I am only using 2 features in the initial NN. Could adding more complexity with additional features improve the accuracy?

6552,2vomul,So you want to be a data scientist‚Ä¶,,"I‚Äôve noticed a bunch of posts here that are of the form ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a X major and want to be a data scientist, what do I do?‚Äù so I thought I would chime in and give my opinion.  I hire data scientists so I thought I would tell you what I look for when I‚Äôm hiring newbies.  Experienced people are another story. 

First, you need to be able to code.  And I‚Äôm more interested in hacking skills more than formal systems development. If you need a formal requirements document and 6 agile sprints to complete a data science engagement you are taking too long.  Besides, 50%-70% of your work will be taking the crappy data you are given and putting it in a form that can be analyzed. For that you‚Äôll need PERL, Python, VB, etc.  After you have done it you probably don‚Äôt need to do it again in the exact same way.  So you need to hack that mother.  It would be awesome if you had minions to do the shit work for you but let‚Äôs face it, if you are just coming out of school you are the minion.  I knew people in grad school that got straight A‚Äôs but couldn‚Äôt program their way out of a paper bag.  I don‚Äôt want those people.  So convince me that you can write code. 

You need to understand data.  This seems to be under represented in ‚Äúhow to be a data scientist‚Äù posts but it is very important.  But  you need to have a good feel for data representation and modeling.  Sooner or later you will need to impose structure on data or the data that is given to you will be highly structured.  Being able to put your data in the correct form can make all the difference in the world when it comes to accuracy and speed of analysis.  

You need to be curious.  If you see a dead squirrel on the top floor of a parking garage and your first thought is ‚ÄúEwwwww, a dead squirrel‚Äù I don‚Äôt want you.  If you first thought is ‚ÄúHmmm, why did that squirrel come up here if there are no trees nearby? There isn‚Äôt any squirrel food around to draw him in.   How did he die? I assume that he was hit by a car but is that really the case?‚Äù  and  you go into full CSI:Rodent mode then you are someone I want to talk to.  If something slightly odd pops up during your analysis it could be your mistake, bad data or an interesting discovery.  All of these are important but if you don‚Äôt notice and follow up on the initial oddity then we‚Äôll never know will we?  I understand if you keep that side of you under wraps around normal people.  I do as well. My friends and close relatives all think I‚Äôm strange when I start wondering out loud about things like that.  If you haven‚Äôt read all the Sherlock Holmes stories then maybe you should.  However, that being said don‚Äôt take it too far.  I‚Äôve seen stats people go down rabbit holes for weeks and come back with a set of technically correct but complete useless results.  This is especially true with big data systems.  There are an infinite number of cool but useless things you can find. Your curiosity should always be filtered though the sieve of practicality.  Just keep asking yourself if what you are investigating will ultimately be useful to the client. 

You need imagination.  There are multiple ways to approach any analytic problem and you need to be able to see most of those.  More importantly you need to be able to imagine entirely brand new problems that can be solved with the data and tools that you have.  If you only find what you are told to find you are a failure.  Convince me that you can see things that others can‚Äôt.  Unless what you see are hallucinations then please keep those to yourself.  



Tell me a story.   You need to be able to convert your brilliant analysis into something that normal people can understand.  If you use the term ‚Äúp-value‚Äù while explaining results to a client I‚Äôll dock your pay.  Unless you are lucky enough to have a client that understands all that stuff. Then by all means, geek out.  You need to have good communications skills.  You need to explain your results, why they are significant and why someone should trust them in a way that civilians understand.  You will also need to interact with clients on a continual basis since you may understand analytic techniques but you most likely won‚Äôt understand the domain you are working in.  A big part of data science is learning about the business domain you are operating in. If you don‚Äôt, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself by giving clients results that are obviously wrong or trivial.  My first results that I delivered to a client many years ago were horribly wrong because of some fundamentally incorrect assumptions I made about the completeness of the data that I would have known about had I asked. And they were completely obtuse.  My work product sucked and I paid the price.  

Finally, you need an area of technical analytic expertise.  This is where your background in stats, machine learning,  natural language processing, etc. comes in.  There isn‚Äôt much to really say here.  If you are coming out of school  this is what your degree should be in or you need to have shown a significant project or two in these areas.  You should be able to describe how to solve a sample problem that I throw at you using your preferred technology. I expect you to be technically competent in one area and conversant in the rest. 

Hmmm, this was way longer than I thought it would be.  Hopefully it helps.  Of course additions, comments and vicious flames welcome.

6553,97exfe,Data Analyst One Year In,,"Hey everyone thought I would post a little bit about my first year out of undergrad and first year as a data analyst. I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6znbdo/data_analyst_one_month_in/) about a my background and a little bit about my job. 

In the past year, I have been promoted from analyst I to analyst II and have been accepted to GT analytics program, which my company has agreed to pay for 70% of tuition and 100% of other fees, while working full time.

I work for a natural gas company and continue to do marketing analytics. In my first year, I have gotten very very very familiar with SQL, and cleaning lots and lots of data (shout out tidyverse). I am lucky enough that my team is small and my work requires me to go from pulling the data, to cleaning the data, to ultimately building a model if necessary. 

There are certain things that I have learned through out my year as an analyst 

* Ask questions. Often if you don't know what is going on with the data someone else does. People tend to be helpful especially when you are starting out. 

* Assume the model you built is too good to be true if you are getting some amazing results. Often times there is some data leakage issue that you did not see immediately, but your skepticism will help you catch that. 

* Build things because there is a dollar amount associated with the knowledge created from your analysis. Nobody cares that you have a cool ML algorithm if it does not save or make the company any money. 

* Always have a simple baseline model to compare more complex models to. Losing easily interpreted coefficients should not be taking lightly. How much more accuracy is worth losing that occasional more actionable insight?

* Get comfortable with SQL, like really comfortable and be prepared to clean data and write views for other people... 

* Comment and version control your code. Bitbucket, github, vsts or whatever you use is your friend. 

* Create pipelines to help with reproducible work. Shout out [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). 

Ask to help others on their projects and please please learn about the company, the business' needs, and goals before building some crazy model. Often times a simple approach is just as good as a black box ML model (not saying all the time). Overall my year as an analyst has been great and I have been fortunate enough to have a boss that is hands off and is willing to take the fall for my mistakes. I am looking forward to learning more about data engineering and going to transition into a sort of in between analyst and data engineer role.",,135,datascience
6554,8g91ad,What paths are there for people who're just average?,,"I mean, I'm not going to go to a good masters programme, odds are I won't do a masters programme at all.  

Hopefully I can leave university with a 2:1 in Maths & Statistics, for which I'll have to work for. 

I'm interested in programming, and statistics. But I wouldn't say I'm good at either. I couldn't create any algorithms and I'd have difficultly giving explanations of basic statistics concepts at the moment. I've done some R and Python, so I could be told what to do. But I couldn't implement anything fancy. 

I see a lot of things about reading papers, fancy algorithms, models, programming, advanced statistics and maths stuff.... but that's clearly not something that I'm going to be applying for. But maybe there are roles on the peripheries that I'm not aware of? I'm not sure. 

There's a lot of content for people who're very capable, but I rarely see much for people who're just standard / average or whatever. So I'm curious whether there's advice about what kind of things are out there for someone like that. 

This isn't a case of being negative or whatever, I find it quite annoying when things are phrased in those terms. It's just the situation that I'm in, because of who I am. So I'm not fishing for  any sort of ""you can do it!"" (*it* being learn advanced stuff and so on) sentiments. 

I'm hoping that I can leave with a reasonable understanding of basic statistics. Regression, hypothesis testing. Along with *some* programming, and hopefully a project that I've implemented. (I appreciate that this might sound ridiculous to some people in this sub, but I assure you that there are many people leaving university without having a good understanding of basic concepts).

6559,blqa4v,Why you should always save your data as .npy instead of .csv,,"I'm an aspiring Data Scientist and through the last few months working with data in Pandas using the standard .csv format I found out about .npy files.

It's really not that much different but it's a LOT faster with regard to loading and handling in general, which is why I made this: https://medium.com/@peter.nistrup/what-is-npy-files-and-why-you-should-use-them-603373c78883

TL:DR; **Loading .npy files is ~70x faster than .csv files. This actually adds up to a lot if you - like me - find yourself restarting your kernel often when you've changed some code in another package / directory and need to process / load your data again!**

Obviously there's some limitations like the use of header / column names, but this is entirely possible to save and load using a .npy file, it's just a little more cumbersome compared to .csv formats.

I hope you find it useful!

**Edit: I'm sorry about the clickbaity nature of the title. I'm in complete agreement that this isn't applicable to every scenario.

Not sure if there has been a similar discussion before but I'm interested in this sub's opinion of things that I call 'data analytics ""lite""'. By that, I specifically mean visually based tools which do not involve real code.

A bit about me: I work in a company that uses Alteryx and Tableau to do the majority of their data analysis. In the past few months, I've realised that there is so much more scope out there for data analysis and data analytics beyond Alteryx and Tableau; namely, things like machine learning, statistical modelling using R, and using languages like Python to do... stuff (not sure exactly what it can do but I've only heard good things).

Recently, when I tried to transition into a more ""technical"" data analytics role that uses Python, R, and SQL, I've been shooed away because of an apparent skill gap. I've got this impression that people think that because I don't actually code at the moment for work, because I use 'drag-and-drop' tools like Tableau/Alteryx, that I don't have the skills to do the ""real"" stuff.

It frustrates me because I learned coding at university and took to it like a fish to water. Moreover, it's not as if I've been sitting around doing nothing - I work with data everyday, it's just usually in csv/Excel/txt format so I use Alteryx instead of SQL, and I don't visualise using ggplot2, but I chuck it into Tableau.

It's just unfortunate I suppose that the line of work I got into after uni is about business-facing analytics and with a heavy emphasis on explanation to stakeholders. After all, what's easier to explain to a non-technical person, a pretty Alteryx workflow that neatly splits out and joins the data, or 100 lines of SQL with SELECT this and INNER JOIN that?

I suppose what I want to get out of posting this is - what the role is of these drag-and-drop tools in organisations that do data analytics, whether learning and honing skill in these is even useful, and how those of us who are using these can transition into the seemingly greener pasture of actual data analytics coding/programming (and is it actually greener?).

6578,8n4ui3,My Review: Unimpressed with Datacamp (for Python),,"I don't know what subreddit is best for this post. Sorry if it's not this one.

So I'm a data analyst, not a data scientist. I just finished grad school (not data science) and I'm between jobs and about to move to a new city, so I've been taking the last few weeks to go through Datacamp's material fairly intensely (~4 hours a day) to upgrade my skills before I get my hopes and dreams crushed by the job market.

...


The **first** thing I noticed about Datacamp was that they did a lot of stuff *for* me. I'd open up an exercise and most of the code had been written already, with a couple of spaces with '____' where I should fill in the right answer. I thought this was really frustrating, because there was never any point in the process where they explained to me why we needed to perform whatever operation it was. I'm like 50 hours in, and I'm not sure I could do any of this without Datacamp's prompting. I think this is the worst part of the Datacamp curriculum. I feel that I'm paying Datacamp to teach me Python syntax and when to use it (not just how to use it), and I feel like I'm not learning either of those things.

**Second,** although Datacamp courses offer short video segments that putatively ""teach"" the course, the exercises were essentially big text boxes. Oftentimes the video and text would be somewhat out of sync, and sometimes it felt like entire sections had been omitted between text and video. This made watching the videos almost completely optional, and considering most of them are shorter than 5 min, there was never enough time to substantively introduce the material anyway.

**Third**, the exercises rarely feel practical. There are some nice real-world datasets used, but because of what I describe in my first paragraph, it's hard to actually interface with them. You're not really working with them yourself. Beyond that, it doesn't feel like Datacamp spends a lot of time trying to motivate the problem. Why do we need to take this approach, etc. There are often domain-specific considerations that influence how the problem may best be solved, and that stuff is completely omitted. This ends up meaning that these supposedly practical exercises end up anything but.

I had a really long paragraph here about how **I dislike their two-part statistics course**. TL;DR: I thought the treatment of linear regression was really shallow and incomplete (there's no mention of residuals at all, for example), and I thought leaving out multiple and logistic regression meant it didn't provide enough for students to actually learn how to work with data. I've never worked as a data scientist, but I understand that those two are important. They're already super useful as an analyst.

**That's not to say that Datacamp is terrible.** I really liked some of the data viz stuff they've got (Seaborn and Bokeh are awesome), and I think their first couple of intro to Python courses are helpful. I've heard great things about their R courses, as well. And Datacamp has got a great platform for what they're doing.

I'm certainly going to finish my month of Datacamp, but I don't think I'll be resubscribing. I know it's kind of a cheap shot, but I feel like I might subscribe to one of their competitor products in the hope that they can teach me more of the syntax and thought process behind this stuff. I'm disappointed to be paying somebody to teach me, only to have to Google what they're supposed to be teaching.",,132,datascience

6580,dh3s7y,How do large data science teams work together and delegate tasks?,,"I've always found this perplexing since the entire Data Science profession appears to be so individualistic on the surface. Considering that the ideal Data Scientist is supposed to be an expert at software development, databases, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, I often wonder how work actually gets done in teams in say a real job.

If you look at other professions say Game development, which pretty much is focused on pushing out a software product (the game) to consumers, the job titles are often clearly defined, and normally broken down into distinct roles of Developer, Artist, Writer and Composer. This is just a gross exaggeration for a  typical indie team (AAA games would have legions of employees), but it is still quite rare if one person does everything.

Now, back to data science - if you had people with PhDs in Maths, Statistics, Computer Science or Physics, how are the tasks even delegated if everyone on the team is at the same education or expertise level? Taking the typical Data Science workflow in mind, surely one of them would be extremely annoyed if all they were assigned to do was data cleaning?

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just over thinking it but I feel like I‚Äôm disappointing my entire data team. I‚Äôve been incredibly anxious at work due to feeling stupid and performing below expectations. It feels like every single member of the team is a genius and working as a cohesive team while I‚Äôm easily the most junior member that gets largely ignored.

Everyone‚Äôs been working long hours including weekends and I‚Äôm usually hesitant to ask questions because of how unimportant my work is compared to what they‚Äôre working on. I do also think that struggling through a problem is good for me in the long run although it can be quite frustrating in the short term. 

Whenever I do ask questions, I try to be as thorough as possible to show that I‚Äôve thought deeply about the problem, but it feels like my manager would rather work on his own stuff.

6613,ghk5ba,Managing Python Dependencies in Data Science Projects,,"Hi there, as you all know, the world of Python package management solutions is vast and can be confusing. However, especially when it comes to things like reproducibility in data science, it is important to get this right. 

I personally started out `pip install`ing everything into the base Anaconda environment. To this day I am still surprised I never got a version conflict. 

Over the time I read up on the topic [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) and [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and this got me a little further. I have to say though, the fact that conda lets you do things in so many different ways didn't help me find a good approach quickly.

By now I have found an approach that works well for me. It is simple (only 5 conda commands required), but facilitates reproducibility and good SWE practices. Check it out [here](https://haveagreatdata.com/posts/data-science-python-dependency-management/).

I would like to know how other people are doing it. What is your package management workflow and how does it enable reproducible data science?",,121,datascience
6614,fgusho,What is the closest Python equivalent of R's dbplyr?,,"Most people who use R for data science are familiar with its [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package. [Dbplyr](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/) allows users to work with remote data stored in databases as if it was in-memory data. Basically, it translates dplyr verbs into SQL queries. Crucially, it has two enormous advantages over simply sending out SQL queries through a connection:

&#x200B;

>The most important difference between ordinary data frames and remote database queries is that your R code is translated into SQL and executed in the database, not in R. When working with databases, dplyr tries to be as lazy as possible:  
>  
>It never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it.  
>  
>It delays doing any work until the last possible moment: it collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a similar package for Python. So far, I've found two packages which do something akin to the ""verb-to-SQL"" translation of dbplyr: [Blaze](https://github.com/blaze/blaze) and [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) (I've actually found them through [this r/datascience post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7w0ap8/the_dplyr_r_package_has_an_explain_function_that/)). Blaze appears to have been more popular than Ibis, but seems to have gone almost completely stale some years ago, while Ibis is in active development. I haven't yet been able to figure out if they offer the same ""laziness"" of dbplyr, so if anyone could clear that out for me, it would be greatly appreciated. Between Blaze and Ibis, which one would you recommend? Additionally, if anyone knows of some better alternative that I haven't mentioned, please share it.",,120,datascience

6619,fcux6f,Pivoting FROM Data Science to CS?,,"I recently (8 months ago) entered the data science sphere after finishing a PhD in a physical science. While it has been extremely enjoyable, especially when compared with academia, I am finding myself more interested in the computer science/programming side rather than the statistics/modeling side of data science. Has anyone had any experience in making this sort of transition, i.e. AWAY from DS to CS? There are plenty of resources for the inverse, but not too much available for this path from what I can find.

Now, I haven't exactly had a CS course or anything like that, I just had to pick up programming during my PhD. I'd say I have a passible understanding of Fortran and C++ from my research, and a decent understanding of Python from my current job. I understand that those skills probably not what would be in demand, but I find that picking up other languages gets easier the more I get exposed to, and more importantly the process behind programming is quite attractive to me. I understand if a CS degree would be worthwhile to pick up, although I am rather burnt out on schooling after 4 years of undergrad and 5 years of graduate school.

I appreciate any thoughts!

Edit: Thanks for all of your comments.

I'm adding an edit to hopefully give a summary for myself and anyone else who stumbles along this post. I'll try to make the results more applicable too given that not everyone has a PhD.

People seem to indicate that there are various paths one could take as a data scientist to transition into a more CS position:

* **Backend developer** **-** would basically entail a clean break from data science in essence; take that as you will. Working with web systems and databases most likely. 
* **DE/MLE -** staying in the ""Data Science Field""**^(TM)**, just moving away from the analysis and into more of the guts of the infrastructure/algorithm deployment. Think big data management or taking your crappy Jupyter notebook and turning into a deployable code framework, optimizing, etc.
* **Quant -** probably the hardest transition, usually reserved for people with post-graduate degrees in a highly technical field. Applying statistical models to the financial sector, predicting what to buy/sell, etc. ",,118,datascience

I browse this subreddit quite a bit. Actually it is the first thing I do when I get to work in the morning. I see a lot of posts about data analyst positions and I thought I would share my current experience one month in. 

A little about myself: I graduated from a very good small liberal arts school not super well known for its science and math programs. But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. 

A little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things. This means I do all the sexy things like cleaning data, cleaning data, and cleaning data. I currently use python and R for a lot of my data manipulation. Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. 

Overall it has been a great experience. My math training has been the most useful to me so far, SQL skills have been slowly improving, and I have yet to use any bayesian tricks which I thought was the coolest thing I have every learned, except for solid state physics. 
 
Please pm with questions, I am happy to share my resume. I just recently went through this process and would be happy to talk about my interview experience and all the times I had to fail in order to get the job I have today. Learn how to make reports and try to enjoy it because it is going to be a big part of being a data analyst. I am going to work on some data pipeline stuff using luigi in python, so I would love to hear if anybody has suggestions or things to watch out for, let me know!

6630,9f85hv,The REAL confusion of starting a journey into Data Science,,"...is the maddeningly different views each DS has. Don't take this as an insult to the group; its an observation.

I suffer from an inability to make decisions and actions, therefore even with clear guidance I struggle to pick a starting point and stick to it. One major contributing factor to this is my compulsive need to read all the ""getting starting,"" articles possible, and the threads that go with it. And while I understand my short comings regarding picking a starting point / plan. Others seem to be having the same problem who may or may not have as much industry knowledge as I do.

In every article there are 2 maybe 3 views, coding, the math and DL:

- Without fail theres always the guys who say just start playing with it, find a dataset you like and find a problem you want to solve and go. I liked this approach and started this way. :)

- Then the comments start on this thread, where its identified if you don't know the math, you are doing it wrong and you don't even know it. ok... makes sense... buuuuuut do I keep chugging along with my project or start taking math courses (overly simplified response but you get the idea)? This is where my spiral starts, and now I'm watching videos on statistics, how to read research papers, taking khan courses on statistics and coursera courses on ML; all while trying to do my project that got me really into this in the first place.

- Then comes the deep learning discussion, ""if you really don't know how do use the right algorithm, its not even worth trying."" Which in my mind is really the same discussion as the math comment but further down that road. 

I don't know if its an opinion of those who do it for fun vs professionally vs academically (or of theres a difference between professional & academic). Its just hard to pick a starting point when the opinions are so vastly different. I know I know, its the internet - but data science is the search for truth within the numbers, maybe we can collectively agree on an approach. Even if its professional vs fun.... Academic I will assume starts with school and ends with school...

My opinion from what I have read thus far:

Professional:

 - Make sure you have a strong understanding of statistical distributions 
 - Make sure you atleast have a foundation of high level math: linear algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics...etc
 - Hypothesis testing and optimization
 - Python / R / SQL / other coding basics
 - Algorithms and training data
 - Start your own projects via kaggle or similar
 - Build your own data set via gathering, cleaning and normalizing and create models / predictions to prove a problem you find
 - Do the above a lot until you have enough to quantify your knowledge on a resume
 - Apply

Fun:

 - Get Math
 - Have coding understanding
 - Know what an algorithm is and how to apply it - read about how it works at some point
 - Follow a Kaggle or similar, tutorial a few times
 - Try an example yourself or find a problem to solve for youself and start

***Above all share your work - regardless of which path you take.***

As I may have stated, I am still very new myself - so the paths above are truly from someone who doesn't know, I just didn't feel right saying hey you guys are smart explain how to do this differently. So I took a stab at a starting point. 

If you got to this point, thank you very much for reading!

I do some machine learning and predictive analysis, lots of visualization and dashboarding, and a fair amount of ETL development. I don't use neural nets or map reduce or any of the fancy stuff that data scientists at tech companies would use.

I was at a Google Cloud Platform training seminar the other day as my company is beginning to adopt it for our day-to-day use. One of the speakers (manager of DS at another firm) mentioned how they had high preference for software engineers, because *""its easier to provide DS tools to a coder than to teach an analyst how to code""*.

With the exposure of DS I've had over the past year or two, I've gathered that the general sentiment is to code and be great at math/stats. When I look at the influencers in this space, I see people with PhDs in math/physics or some sort of proven programming background.

As for myself, I graduated with a business degree and I've maintained a career today because I'm well-versed in web/mobile analytics. When I perform my analysis, I'm essentially using analytics platforms (e.g. Adobe/Google), SQL when looking at online-offline data and spreadsheets to discover insights; like any BA would.

However, in my space, I'm slowly noticing data scientists build presence in the business space; like unicorns that can code, run models and *present analysis + insights.* And when I'm looking for other web/mobile related jobs, Python and R are already job description standards. I feel that BAs won't have the competitive advantage to compete against data scientists with software and/or doctorate backgrounds in the near future.

Today, I try to chip away at Datacamp or Python when I can. I've managed to get some basics down, like accessing APIs or running basic regression models. But I treat Data Science like a hobby, something I do for a few hours to a dozen a week (if I'm feeling it). Nonetheless, I don't have it in me to follow the footsteps of what accomplished data scientists have been through.

What can analysts like me practice and build in our ""playbook"" to stay relevant without having to pour 20+ hours a week to hone the craft? Or is DS a subject matter you just can't ""half-ass""?

One I recently discovered was the magic command for reloading local Python modules when changes occur. I'm working half in PyCharm and half in a notebook, so when I'd change something to my modules in PyCharm, the changes wouldn't show up for use in the notebook.

Turns out you can use the magic command above your imports to first load the extension required, then you can define which module you'd like to autoreload:
    
    %load_ext autoreload    # load the extension
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    %aimport DataCleaningModule    # designate which module to reload each cell run
    from DataCleaningModule import text_processors as proc

If you have a .py in your module you want to reload every time (*text_processors* in my case) you just need to use *%aimport* on the module that contains your .py and Jupyter will get the changes every time you run a cell!

6640,ccczmq,Understanding Engineering Graduate Programs as a Path to becoming a Data Scientist,,"I typed this in a reply on the Entering and Transitioning thread, and I figured it may be useful to some.

Broadly speaking, there are two really large types of data science jobs out there:

1. What I call ""hardcore machine learning jobs"", i.e., jobs in which you are either working under the hood of machine learning models, or you are deploying them into production environments.
2. What I call ""applied data science jobs"", i.e., jobs in which you are using data science methods to solve business problems.

**If your goal is to work in jobs of the first type, your best bet is to get a graduate degree in computer science**. That is by no means the only way to get there, but that is going to be the best aligned degree to prepare you with the combination of programming, database, algorithmic, math and machine learning that you would need to work on that. (PS: don't @ me to tell me about how you became a Research Scientist at Google with a bachelor's degree in underwater basket weaving)

**If your goal is to work in jobs of the second type, then there are a lot of different types of programs that can get you there.** One general class of such programs are engineering graduate degrees. Why? Because engineering is literally the field that we as humanity created to solve real-world problems using math. 

Specifically, graduate programs in engineering tend to focus on how to apply more advanced mathematical methods to solve more complex problem within their given domains. So, while an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering may teach you the basics of how to determine the optimal duration of each cycle for the traffic lights at an intersection, a graduate degree in Civil Engineering may focus on developing models to predict how congestion will develop across the network representation of a city's traffic network. While an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering may teach you how to apply pre-determined standards for how to decide on what the tensile strength on a material needs to be on a standard shape like a washer or bolt, a graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering may focus on how to develop a model that best predicts the tensile strength of a component of arbitrary shape.

You get the point: Engineering = solve problems with math, Grad Engineering = solve hard problems with more complex math.

Now, because Engineering *applies* math, in general it borrows from a lot of other areas. There are obviously the core building blocks that they borrow from Math, Physics and Chemistry (e.g., Statics, Dynamics, Electricity, Magnetism, Thermodynamics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Probability, Statistics, etc.), but in modern Engineering these fields have started borrowing from other ""derived"" fields such as Economics, Computer Science, Business, etc. 

So, for example, Transportation Engineering makes strong use of Network Analysis & Optimization - which came of age in Computer Science - in their use of shortest path/network equilibrium concepts to predict traffic. Industrial Engineering makes use of Econometrics to create models that attempt to optimize responses to customer demand, etc.

The most noteworthy engineering discipline (as far as Data Science goes) is, in my opinion, Operations Research (aka Decision Science). Operations Research was Data Science before Data Science, i.e., it was the first effort by the academic community to use data and analytics to improve decision making. This field was born out of World World II when the British military started using data to make better strategic decisions.

This area has traditionally focused on three big building blocks:

1. Probability and Statistics - specifically with applications to forecasting and stochastic processes
2. Optimization - specifically with applications to finding the best option among a set of possible decisions (and therefore leaning on both mathematical programming, analytics methods and heuristics)
3. Domain expertise: OR has overwhelmingly focused on specific problems that have become ""classical"" OR problems (e.g., vehicle routing, inventory management, scheduling, etc.) which are 1-1 aligned with real world problems (overwhelmingly in the supply chain management world).

Machine learning (and therefore legit data science) have not been traditionally core to these programs, but as Data Science has become more popular, these programs have either incorporated such concepts into their curriculums and/or worked with other departments (like CS) to have their students take approved electives on those subjected.

That makes OR a very versatile degree that is very well suited to start a career is a more business-centric data science role. However, OR is not the only department in which you can achieve that - if you look at the professors and areas of research in each engineering discipline and sub-area of study, you will likely find people doing work in applying data science to their specific domains - and these can also be alternative courses of study *especially if you come from that undergraduate track*.

So, for example, if you did your undergrad in Chemical Engineering, you could look at what programs and professors are doing research in applications of Data Science to chemical engineering problems - and then get a MS in Chemical Engineering where your coursework and research are focused on Data Science. 

It's not the most direct track in that some hiring managers (i.e., non-technical managers) may not understand the relationship. But most technical hiring managers will.

Why is this important? Two reasons:

1. For those who come from an engineering undergraduate background, a graduate degree in their field of study may be a much less daunting transition than moving into a MS in CS, Stats, Math, etc.
2. Engineering programs are going to have much better brand equity than MS in DS programs - therefore, especially for more old-school hiring managers (read: people in their 40s), they may carry more/better weight than MSDS programs.
3. Engineering programs have a lot of research money at their disposal, which means that (especially at good programs), you have a really good shot at not only getting your education paid for, but also getting a stipend *and that is true even for international students*. Also, schools will often want to keep their undergrads as grad students, so you may have even more incentives from your school to stay as a grad student if you were a really good student in undergrad.

6643,az5er1,My Data Science Job Hunting Experience and Tips,,"I recently got my first job as a data scientist and wanted to share some thoughts about the job hunt process and tips I found helpful for landing a first gig in the field.

&#x200B;

Some background (without giving away too much PI): I had a varied education and career path to this point. Both my BSc, MSc, and PhD were in STEM fields. I decided to make the switch to data science after seeing some friends have success in the area.

&#x200B;

I had no formal experience in data science/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt.

&#x200B;

To form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something.

&#x200B;

After this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this.

&#x200B;

So, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.

&#x200B;

Interviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:

1. The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like ""why are you interested in this company"", ""how do you face challenges"", etc.
2. 2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with ""explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it"". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice ""lecture"" about an algo, because some would just say ""explain your favorite algorithm"".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that.
3. 3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said ""do something interesting"". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say ""this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in"". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a ""template"" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue.

&#x200B;

Final tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.

&#x200B;

Also I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The whole process took about 3 months. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P.

&#x200B;

Remember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation. As you're applying, learn something new everyday.",,115,datascience

I had a talk with my manager, shortly after my previous post here. She doesn't really know much (I'm probably being generous, she doesn't know shit) about Data Science and Machine Learning, but she assured me that she'd get me in touch with a BI and Analytics team.

A few weeks later, she initiated talks with the BI and Analytics team, and there could be an opening there, but there's no certainty that I'd get to work with them as they're looking for exactly one person, and I might have to compete with about 2-3 senior team members.

Nevertheless, I get a call from my manager today, telling me that I have a week to learn enterprise level ChatBot development with C# and NodeJS, due to two enterprise level ChatBot developers with 5+ years of experience each leaving the company.

It's essentially a tool that wraps scikit-learn, xgboost, and the rest of the python DS stack to allow for quick modeling of incremental value.

tl;dr at bottom
My dillema: 
I don‚Äôt know how to move forward with the experience that I have. In fact, I don‚Äôt know which routes I can take yet as I‚Äôm not sure whether the experience I have is enough to move forward. Very confused!
So I‚Äôm pretty stumped at the moment as to where I can go with the experience I have.

Experience I have: 
6 months of SQL(stored procedures and created one custom table)
2 years of VBA (automated a few processes as well as helping another department when they called upon me for help)
3 years of Excel (definitely know my way around formulas and would be confident creating a complicated spreadsheet for anybody, although have never had experience creating graphs.....ever)
Also, I‚Äôve used Cognos Cubes in my current role to extract data but these are simple pivot tables so I don‚Äôt see a point in naming this out on my resume.

The roles that I have held have always been the types where the tasks and responsibilities are repetitive and have never allowed me to call upon my creativity (tbh, I'm not sure if I have any creativity at this point). They have been roles where, if you wrote down a step by step guide, anybody could do the job. This is not to say that the jobs were super easy. The jobs were repetitive but one wrong step, and you've effed up the whole file (you may not even notice you messes up).

The issue is, I feel, that I do not have soft skills that I see in many job specifications that I feel I could go for.
For example, most of the roles require an individual to have experience in pulling insights from data. I have never been in a role where I have helped in this type of way, so this excludes me from many roles.
Additionally, all of the more technical roles require more specialisation in the technical competencies mentioned in the job posting.
For example, SQL Developer roles require specialised SQL experience.

So, what now??
The experience I have puts me in a position where I am unable to do much as I don't any sort of significant experience. I have looked into learning Python, but it is such a diverse language with so many uses that I'm not sure where to start, I mean for one I need to pick a path first.
The goal is, in 5 years, to be able to offer my services to companies as a contractor and become established as a contractor in a field that I choose to go down.
I have looked into roles such as DBA and BI Developer but do not want to pick these two path before I know every possible path I can take from here.

What do you guys think? Are my options wide open because I'm still at an early stage of my career?
For those of you who have been in similar positions, where have you gone on from there?
Are there any recommended websites, blogs, reddit posts you think would help clearing up my head with this at the moment?

Thanks for reading the long post!

TL;DR: 3 years excel, 2 years vba and 6 months sql  experience. With the lack on of insight analysis experience what routes can I take from here??

The project is called Deep Learner. This is a project my and my friends worked on during one of the Hackathons I thought it would be appropriate for this sub. The purpose of this project is to allow people prototype Deep Neural networks very very quickly and with writing 0 lines of code. For now you can only build regular dense networks. It also allows for data visualization using Tableau and you can also save models in json format. Please note this is very much work in progress and was made by 4 college students in 24 hours, so there will be bugs. We decided to make this open source, so you are more than welcome to contribute, I have posted a couple issues on github so feel free to contribute.  We are hoping to expand on it in the near future.

Haven't found a job on that (so no experience) and recently found a position at the current workplace involved with Risk (might not have ts either). Seeking for advice. 

Hello everyone! 

I'm a DS working at an important Bank in my country. Here I've been dealing with solving problems with unstructured data, like videos, images and text. It's being interesting, but I feel quite unsatisfied. I mean, I studied economics and I'm doing a MSc in Statistics. I love time series in a theoretical way, since I can't find a job that works with them. 

I thought that working at a bank would be cool and have some forecast related projects I could work on... but I couldn't work on any.  

You see in my department there are many areas for data analysis, but not for data modeling, except mine and other. The other area makes churn models, and sometimes recommendation systems. 

I feel I'm taking a wrong path for my future. I have no finance related experience (images, text?) Neither time series Modelling experience (aside from the theoretical one). 

I want to change and I recently found a position at the bank that deals with Risk and I think I might go for it (it's no time series related, but is bank related).  But my boss and the director of the area I work on don't want me to move. They say they really like my work, and that we have many projects we can work on, particularly since my area is gaining a lot of credibility. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if the position in Risk involves modelling and predicting as much as I'd like, or if it will just be analyzing and giving back raw numbers. 

Should I stay and keep looking for TS related jobs, or change to the Risk to gain insights and learn from the bank duties and may find place for forecasting? Should I just take this, grow in this side and hope to find something in the future? 

I'm very confused. And I think that this decision could impact my future, my happiness and many things in my life.",,104,datascience

While I generally enjoy doing strategic consulting my real passion is data analysis.

Over the last two years I have prioritized evolving from run-of-the-mill market research analysis towards using more advanced analytics. I use R & Python now instead of SPSS, train ML models (Random Forest, Xgboost, etc.) instead of simply multivariate analysis and have dipped into advanced stuff like neural nets,etc.

I`d really like to switch towards a pure data science role because I like the work and want to get away from consultant work hours.

However in the end I do not have a CS background and while I understand the basics do not have time to really get familiar with stuff like SQL,non-analytics Python and possible languages to prototype apps and front-ends. From a practically stand point my current work really only focuses on analytics (based on mostly available data) as well as the strategic context (which questions to ask, what to do with the answers as well as consulting business on how to develop DS capabilities). None of the models I developed have ever been put into production for example.

I don`t think that would be a problem if I want to switch towards entry level data science but I feel with my business and management background I should aim higher (even if just to avoid a wage downgrade).

Taking this all together I do not know whether I am actually skilled and desirable enough for the senior level data science roles I covet.

What do you think?

6720,bq7jqr,Data Science Career: Management vs Senior Data Scientist.,,"I am standing at a crossroads in my career. 

I am the team lead of the data science and analytics team in a med size engineering company. Our tasks revolve around failure analysis, spectroscopy models, mining production data to optimize processes and so on. Generally it is extremely interesting work that involves a lot of math, inferential statistics, sometimes classical ML, occasionally DL (mostly for fun) and a lot of visualization. I am in a great relationship with my boss, VP of Research, who reports directly to the CEO and de facto second in command in our bigger multidisciplinary research team. 

Earlier this year my boss told me that she would like me to become a manager in my own right and take on more organizational tasks. As an incentive the data science team would break out as an independent department serving the needs of the company as a whole, not research first and other departments second. I would have the opportunity to grow the team (we are 4 now) and it goes without saying that the salary would get adjusted accordingly. 

The cost however is that I will no longer be able to spend any significant amount of time doing data science work directly. It would have to be done by proxy of my team. I would set the goals, define priorities, review the work, etc. in other words this is almost a 90 degrees turn on the career path. The focus shifts from technical to business and company needs, customer needs and so on. That is no more thinking how to best setup a PGM to describe and explain the results of experiments that the optics team is running in the lab. 

Alternatively I could just continue to grow as a data scientist. But I am afraid to be too expensive as a front line engineer in 15 - 20 years. I‚Äôve seen it happen before. Guys who spent their entire life doing the engineering work are too expensive by the time they are 50 and are the first ones to be laid off when the times are not so great. In addition our area of research is niche, and while I can easily find transferable skills into other industries, it will be something I will have to proof to potential employers should I decide to change job.

6728,b5yx8h,How do you monitor the performance of models deployed to production ?,,"TL;DR: I did a performance analysis of my production classifier and would like to know what's the method that you guys use, and whether there are any flaws to my idea.

&#x200B;

I work with text mining and the most important model that I have is a document classifier. It classifies if a particular document is a contract or not.

&#x200B;

My team created a pipeline that fetches documents, OCR them, classify them and make them available in a web application, so that our users can find them way faster than by using the other methods.

&#x200B;

The classifier was trained with 1K documents and deployed with > 90% F-score to production (I did the training, testing and validation stuff to prevent overfitting). We then needed to tell the stakeholders our classification accuracy, because of that, I sampled 1K from the 33K classified documents and we manually annotated the sample so that we could calculate the number of contracts labeled as not contracts (false negatives) and the number of documents that were not contracts but were classified as contracts (false positives).

&#x200B;

I then looked at the false positives and false negatives for patterns, after finding patterns in the errors, I created regular expressions that reduced the error for some patterns, and re-trained the models for the other patterns that came from new documents that were entirely different from the samples we had in the initial dataset. After updating the model, the F-score went up to > 90% again, and we got better results when looking in the web application, so the problem of performance was solved. BUT, I think my approach to this problem was very intuitive and not very science-y, so I figured out another way of doing this, a more statistical way.

&#x200B;

What I'm thinking about doing in the next time, is to make a [sample size calculation](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) using the total of documents in production as the population, confidence level of 95% percent and confidence interval of 3%. Then do a random sample of N documents, annotate them and calculate the F-score.

&#x200B;

Now, my fellow data scientists, I would like to know how you do this kind of performance monitoring for classifiers. Also, do you think that my idea has any flaw ?

&#x200B;

Another thing, my new idea will use a confidence interval of 3%, does that imply that the score that I calculate after annotating documents from my random sampling will have a range of +- 3% ? For example if I calculate a F-score of 94%, does it mean that my F-score, actually is 91-97%, because I did a sample of the population ? Or am I oversimplifying things and this is not how confidence intervals actually work ?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for the input, I really appreciate it. Statistics is my weakness, since I entered data science from software engineering field.

Will share my story but heavily changed to protect the guilty.  

I work(ed) in a safety field where people die based on decisions. We risk rate things, and use our limited resources to prioritise what we need to fix. For arguments sake, I have put this in the context of safety of vehicles.

Someone in another department came up with a subjective but otherwise understandable way of risk rating. Things  like 

* if there are seatbelts, subtract 1
* add the number of accidents in the last year
* if there is speed monitoring, subtract 1
* if no licence is required, add 2
* subtract 1 for every time they have been inspected  


As you can see, some of these were real numbers, some ordinal, some categorical and so on.

These numbers are added to give a final ""risk"" score for a vehicle. So far, so dodgy.

However, this total ""number"" was then ranked, and then multiplied by the number of passengers to give an overall value, which was then multiplied by the amount of safety dollars we had to spend to work out what we should do.

6749,b08fzi,Politics and Psychology of Data Science's 'Last Mile',,"Dear fellow DS-Redditors,

in our company, my Data Science team is currently struggling with the 'last mile', i.e. have our insights and predictions bring about actual change.

We have sufficiently mastered the technical aspects, with APIs and platform at our disposal and available to others. Also, we've established trust with senior management executives.

What remains is to convince coworkers from other departments, e.g. sales, to work with us. Many hesitate to cooperate or to make use of our results and our work, and I feel like this boils down to a couple of human reasons:

* The generally resist change, especially when initiated by others
* Their division manager might have a long-standing rivalry with our division manager
* They see us and our suggestions/results as 'invading their territory'
* They view us as young and snobbish know-it-alls

How would you approach this problem? 

As a last measure, we could make our case with the executive level and have them pressure their guys to cooperate. However, we'd really like to solve this problem 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down'.

Cheers and thank you!
Derek

That being said, my Bachelor's put no emphasis on programming, and perhaps underemphasized the math department.

The question is to check if the ad campaign has any effect. When plotted, this data is found to be cyclical. My approach was to use the first 40 days to build a time series model based on first 40 days and use it to predict the downloads for the next 20 days(i.e; simulate how the downloads would be had there been no ad campaign) and compare these values with actual available data with a t-test. Is this approach correct? Would appreciate any suggestions.

6771,bif3w2,The Data Incubator: An In-Depth Review,,"#Introduction

Hello, my name is Alexander and I'm a recent graduate of [The Data Incubator](http://thedataincubator.com) program.

I know before I joined the program [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) was an invaluable tool in helping me make my final decision to attend (a big shout out to all members who responded to my private messages) and this in-depth (read: way too long) review is my small attempt to give back. I also believe that my perspective is somewhat unique in that most of the existing great reviews out there are from a fresh grad/post-doc perspective while mine is one from someone who is already an  experienced professional looking to transition into data science.

#About Me

I'm formerly trained in computer science and have been a [Senior Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandersack314/) for over 15 years. I started my career with a deep love of operating systems and UNIX (I'm getting old, I remember installing RedHat from a dozen or so floppy disks) so the first half of my career has been spent writing fairly low-level/high performant (well, sometimes) code mainly in C/C++. So think storage and network drivers, boot code, deep packet inspection, and just general platform work.

However in 2016, I read [""The Great A.I. Awakening"" in the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) and was completely blown away by it. The only time I have ever heard of anything related to neural networks was the venerable perceptron algorithm which I knew was [used on some CPUs for branch prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/903263). But I had no idea how far the AI community had come with deep learning and vowed that I wanted to be part of the action too! Since then I've taken numerous online MOOCs on machine learning and now consider [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) to be one of my closest friends (disclaimer: I have never met Professor Ng).


#The Data Incubator (TDI)

If you aren't familiar with [TDI's Fellowship program](https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html), it is considered by many to be one of the premier data science bootcamps in the country (US anyway). It is an eight week program that is supposed to not only teach you the foundations of data science but also help you land a job as well through their ever expanding partner network. Their main competitor is probably [Insight](https://www.insightdatascience.com) but they are also battling an entire cottage industry of multi-week camps such as [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/) and [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com) to name a few.

##Admissions

What's makes TDI somewhat unique compared to other bootcamps is their non-trivial admission process which is broken down into three rounds:

* Resume/CV Review
* Project Challenge
* Capstone Pitch

My guess is the majority of folks get past the first round provided you have a graduate degree from a [reputable university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO1061QisVs) but get rejected in the second round during the project challenge phase. They claim their acceptance rate is 2-3% which is about right: My cohort I think had ~4k applicants with a little less than 36 attending.

The project challenge is actually broken down into two or three subprojects with each subproject covering areas of probability, statistics, and basic data science (mostly dataset handling and EDA, not modeling). I would say knowledge of Python is pretty much required to get through the challenges intact.

This is how it works: TDI will send you a link to a real, midsized dataset (at least a few gigabytes) and ask you to perform some in-depth EDA about it. For the stats/probs part, they will ask you to write some code to simulate an experiment and then ask various basic probability questions about your results. So I would say if you are looking to ""book-up"" for the admissions process you should be fairly comfortable with Python, pandas/numpy, web scraping, and SQL. Obviously, challenge questions will vary with each cohort but my guess is they are all similar with respect to the skillsets you need to do them. You have a few days to finish it and can submit as many times as you want, i.e. you can work on some, submit, work on another part, submit, redo the first section, submit, etc.

I talked to several classmates about the challenge project and I think on average most folks said they spent at least 20 hours working on it - so be prepared. The admission process says it takes a few hours to finish but that is just not realistic unless you happen to be not only fluent in the above technologies (I was) but also familiar with the dataset in question (obvioulsy not).

Frankly, I found all the challenge problems to be a lot of fun! I got to not only flex my data science muscles but also learn a few things along the way. However, I must admit that if I hadn't gotten accepted into the program it would have been a heavy investment on my part with very little gain (I literally didn't sleep one Friday night coding one of the challenges up, read: the wife was not happy).

If you make it pass the first two rounds, next is your capstone pitch which consists of a stand alone short video of yourself explaining what you want to do for your capstone project as well as a separate video preso further explaining it. It's typically very high level though; some candidates (including yours truly) had alpha/beta-ish projects from other courses as a basis which gave us a clear advantage while others were still in the incubation stage (literally a single page with scribbles on it that vaguely resembled ""Look out, Data Science!"").

Note that this round is mainly about gauging your personality, how you present in front of a crowd under a time crunch, and how articulate you are when talking about a technical topic. My main advice here would be to practice your pitch and have a few sensible slides to work off of. Please note that you do not get to share your desktop but rather have to send your slides to everyone over a chatroom, which means you can't drive the whole process as you normally would in a formal presentation.

If all goes well, you're in! Congrats!

##Fellow vs. Scholar

During the admission's process, you can apply to be a Fellow or a Scholar but what does that *really* mean since both are part of the Fellowship program?

Fellows attend TDI tuition free but have to **agree to interview with TDI's partner network for a period of time** before being able to interview with any company of their choosing and have to **attend in-person** and thus can not be online.

Scholars on the other hand have to **pay a tuition fee** but are **not tied to TDI's partner network**. They can also **attend online** and are **eligible for a 50% refund if they land a job with a partner**.

However, after the admissions process, everyone is treated as a Fellow, i.e. there is no distinction during and after the program. It's purely an admission distinction only, and in fact the faculty at TDI treat everyone as Fellows - that includes partner meetings, projects, you name it. Again, there is no distinction once you start the program.

I attended the program as an Online Fellow since I worked full-time and was not going to leave my current job without another one in-hand.

##Online vs In-Person

One aspect about the TDI Fellowship that really stands out is that it was designed to be accessible for online students since its inception. It's one of the major reasons why I applied in the first place and why I think the Insight program is a bit behind the times in this regard.

But that begs the question: Do you loose anything by being an Online Fellow instead of attending In-Person? Yes, there are a few drawbacks:

* It's harder to build a relationship with any of the extremely talented and smart people in your cohort. My advice is if you are near any of TDI offices you should trek in for various events such as Partner Panels mainly in order to mingle with your classmates. That's how I made a few friends!

* Some of the resident data scientists are honestly not as chatty as they should be over Slack. Getting help at times was like pulling teeth and it shouldn't really feel that way. Obviously, your mileage may vary, but that's how I felt throughout the course minus our capstone group leader who was awesome.

* Working with the HR folks over Slack can be very painful. For example, an announcement is made for a company you are really interested in interviewing with but have a few basic questions not covered by the CRM so you quickly direct message the primary contact managing that account hoping to get an answer immediately. Think again. My guess is these folks are uindated with requests all day long and it's just hard for them to be very interactive over chat. Most of the time I would send a direct message and wait at leat 24 hours for a response. My guess is if you were in person it would be easier to interact with these folks and get the information you need faster or at least confirm the person is researching the answer for you. When you are online, you stare at a blank chat window for a while and hope they get back to you. I actually think one big improvement would be to treat the CRM kinda like [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and have the ability to file Issues in your dashboard (each Issue would be a question that would start a thread). I think this would be much more effective way for everyone involved.

* Attending Partner Panels as an Online Fellow meant very little interactivity with said partner - both during and after the session is over.

* There is no graduation ceremony for Online Fellows. Very minor but definitey something they could easily improve upon. I kinda felt that with the Online folks they should do a final get together to talk a little bit about their experience and do some kind of exit interview as a group.

##Location, Location, Location!

TDI is a self-styled WeWork company so all the classes are held in shared workspaces (read: at any given moment that location's wireless connection may just drop). At the time of this writing, the main office locations are in New York, San Francisco and D.C. Everyone else is online. Note that your daily lecture maybe given from any of these sites based on what resident TDI DS is teaching it.

Here's the thing: If you do decide to attend in-person, your location will have a huge impact on your placement as the bulk of TDI partners are located in New York and San Franscisco (which to some extent is to be expected). If you are willing to relocate though, then this may not be too much of a big deal. But for those looking for jobs in their local metropolitan area, you are most likely on your own. Don't get me wrong, TDI has partners worldwide (seriously they do) but there is definitely a high concentration of them that bookend the US Coasts.
 
##Onboarding

Before you officially start your cohort, TDI has a 12-day onboarding program that they recommend you work on as well as **a homework project that you must complete and submit before attending class**. So be prepared to start coding on day one after accepting the Fellowship.

The 12-day program is a crash course in data structures and algorithms, probability/statistics, and Python. Take it seriously. One of the biggest mistakes many Fellows made was to not to do go through the 12-day program in earnest and to work on their day-one homework assignment late in the game. I'm telling you as someone who knew about 95% of the 12-day program that I still needed a refresher on a few things: When is the last time you did any kind of dynamic programming? When is the last time you had to write quicksort from scratch? You get the idea.

##A Day In the Life of a Fellow

Each day the course follows the following outline:

* Coding challenge
* One hour lecture on the topic of the week
* Time to work on the Mini-Project due that week
* Capstone group hours/pitch night discussion (twice a week)
* Job interview lecture (twice a week)
* Office hours (once a week) to discuss any mini-project issues/roadblocks
* Partner Panels (one or two a week after the first month or so)

###Coding Challenges

Every morning you have an hour to do a coding challenge. They are mandatory and vary wildly in quality. Once thing that really bothered me throughout the course was the fact that the coding challenges are somewhat random both in topic and difficulty. I also generally believe that [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems are generally less useful than say [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) which groups coding interview questions by company which is key if you are trying to find a common thread of topics across industries to study (and also somewhat motivating knowing full well that you may see that exact problem in an actual interview). There were many times while struggling on one particular HackerRank ""Hard"" problem where I was like no one (not even Google) is gonna ask me this.

The resident data scientists will go over the solution afterwards; though the reference solutions are sorely lacking in detail and occasionally flat out ridiculous, i.e. the solution will focus on brevity instead of explainability. But overall, I do think the coding challenges were good practice and gets you in the mode of what a job interview could be like. 

###Lectures

Every day there is lecture on a particular aspect of a major overarching topic for that week. So one week it maybe on machine learning while another week maybe dedicated to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/). Since they are only an hour each, it can sometimes feel very overwhelming, or counter intuitively very underwhelming, depending on your existing background on the topic and the course material itself. Most of the material is driven from a bunch of loosely coupled Juptyer notebooks which is good and bad - I found there was absolutely no excuse to have to open up multiple notebooks for an hour long lecture. I think that is just lazy and the notebooks should be re-organized accordingly. But I admit it's a relatively minor grievance in the grand scheme of things.

As for quality, again, it varies a lot. For example, I got a lot out of the Apache Spark and MapReduce lecture series and miniprojects since I have never worked with either of those technologies before and was very eager to learn. However ironically, I didn't get that much out of the machine learning ones since I already knew most of the material.

Overall, I think the lectures were OK. It's just very hard to teach advanced subjects in one hour chunks and it shows.

###Mini-Projects

The mini-projects are nothing short of fantastic! Seriously, if there is one aspect of the program that I think they got right it's this one. They are challenging, realistic, and attempt to really test your understanding of the subject matter they cover. They are also as a result a lot of work and sometimes a bit frustrating too (and this is coming from someone who finished all of them a month early).

Every Satudary that week's mini-project is due and is auto-graded on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale. You need to get a 0.9 or higher on every mini-project to graduate the program. If you fall behind then you loose access to the CRM until you catch up. One thing they made clear is that this isn't to punish the Fellow. Rather, it's to ensure you understand the underlying course material - and I agree with them. Completing these mini-projects not only gives you a sense of accomplishment but actually makes you feel like a data scientist!

###Capstone

Throughout the course you will be working on [your capstone](https://deepmetal.herokuapp.com/). The capstone can be the one you pitched during the admission process or can be sponsored by a TDI partner. I know what you're thinking: Of course, I'm going to do one sponsored by a TDI partner since that will allow me to get in the door for a interview and land that dream job! Well, yes and no.

I had two online colleagues that did sponsored projects and were treated pretty poorly by their partners. One person finished the capstone and the partner didn't even show up to watch the person pitch it during Pitch Night (I'm pretty sure they didn't even get an interview to boot). Ironically, another was treated fairly well up until he actually finished the project (he did a fantastic job too) only to find out that his partner wasn't really interested in hiring him full-time. My advice is to research the ""sponsor"" first and try to gauge if there is a post-capstone process in place.

In general though, I would pick a capstone you feel somewhat passionate about - either in its subject matter or its methodology. Remember, this project is mainly for you in that it gives you something to talk about in an interview when asked what kind of DS have you done outside of saving passengers on the Titanic (drum roll please)!

###Job Interview Lectures

These were obviously less useful for me since I have been in the industry for many years and have gone through several interviews in my career. There are few things that I strongly disagreed with that they stressed during the lecture (outside of maybe finance I would never ever wear a suit and tie to an interview - not happening) but that's for a another day.

Overall the job presos were presented well and I did learn how to write a proper cover letter (though a few of my more experienced colleagues debated if anyone actually reads them?). I am also very happy with my updated resume.

###Pitch Night

Pitch Night is exactly what it sounds like: Fellows pitch their capstones to a few TDI partners in order to both sell themselves and indirectly the quality of the TDI program. I participated in it and I thought the experience was positive overall. I **did** have the feeling that Pitch Night is more about TDI showing off their product (read: me) more so than about Fellows getting actual job interviews. But to be fair, that might have been more to do with the group of partners that showed up than the actual format of the program itself (read: selection bias).

If you do happen to be one of the lucky souls that gets voted to do Pitch Night, I encourage you to do it. The process is a bit nerve racking but the TDI staff really excelled at making sure you were ready for it.

###Partner Panels

A Partner Panel is where a TDI partner is invited to one of the WeWork office spaces scattered over the country to give some background about their company, how they hire, what's it like to be a data scientist, etc. Usually, an in-person Fellow is the panel ""lead"" and is responsible for introducing the partner and asking the first set of questions.

I found that the quality varied widely - some partners were really prepared and made me want to interview with them. Others, not so much. But even more disappointing was the fact that Online Fellows had practically zero interaction with these folks which put us at a disadvantage. I also think that this process could be improved a lot by formalizing the partner side more, i.e. require them to follow a certain format and answer a few standard questions right off the bat. But overall I think they were generally positive experiences and I did learn a lot by just listening to partners answer other people's questions. 

##The ""CRM""

TDI's partner network is encapsulated by their internal [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management) website that allows bidirectional communication between Fellows and Partners. Fellows can spam Partners with their CV/resumes and cover letters begging for an interview while Partners can peruse Fellow's resumes/CVs and contact them directly.

**The good**: TDI has built a fairly large partner network and it is ever growing. Also TDI's reputation as far as I can tell is pretty good within the industry, e.g. there are some partners who only hire TDI graduates believe it or not!

**The bad**: The CRM is simply not kept up to date. So there were many, many partners in the CRM that were either listed as inactive or unresponsive. Worse still, there were some partners who were listed as ""active"" who really weren't. Obviously, some of this stuff is out of TDI's control but it is disheartening to spend hours crafting a cover letter the stuff of legends only to find out the company isn't hiring.

**The ugly**: The site iself I found pretty awful in layout and design. Seriously, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is their friend. I also thought even simple things are missing like complete descriptions about what the company does, have they hired TDI fellows before, and any interviewing tips you should know (you can ask for this but I think it should just be baked into the CRM as a free service for Fellows).

##Conclusion/TLDR

TDI is overall a good program and definitely helped me transition into data science. But your results will vary a lot depending on your location, your background, and the number of partners involved in your particular cohort. I think the TDI staff is excellent but there are numerous places where they could improve the Fellowship's overall daily flow as well as make it a bit more personal (especially for Online folks).

##FAQ

- Can you attend TDI as an Online Fellow while working a full-time job?

You can but it will be difficult. I did the program this way but benefited from the fact that I knew the basics of all the topics being discussed and I already worked from home twice a week. The latter allowed me the flexibility to attend all of the mid-afternoon lectures and participate in my capstone study group. Lectures are usually at noon EST so I could just use my lunch hour to watch them. There were a few Online Fellows who did somthing similar. Some were successful, some still struggled to balance everything and fell behind (but did evenutally complete the program).

But the workload is a lot so be prepared to work long nights and weekends. I lost every night and my entire weekend for a few weeks which can be really tough if you have a family (read: I do).

- Am I guaranteed a DS job if I take this program?

Probably not. Based on talking to a lot of folks who took the program in past cohorts, most were still looking for jobs months after the program ended. Again, it's really the luck of the draw when it comes to the number of partners who are participating and how many of them are actually hiring.

- Ok, but do I have a better chance of landing a job if I'm a TDI graduate?

I would say generally speaking, yes! Particularly if you have no formal background in DS whatsoever (like yours truly). It gives you an instant network to work with between TDI's and your fellow classmates. Moreover, if things go well, you will at least land a few interviews off the bat and get some practice in. All good experiences for landing that first DS job!

- Do you really have an advantage using their CRM versus applying directly on the partner website?

It depends. I believe in general, for smaller companies, you absolutely do have an advantage as a Fellow over a random applicant off the ether since you usually get to talk directly to a hiring manager. For larger companies though, I think you are treated like everyone else as most of the contacts are either someone in HR or a corporate wide recruiter.

- What does the average TDI graduate make?

It varies wildly depending again on your location, your existing experience, and the industry you are working in. You already knew that so this answer is not going to be very satisfying. However, it is the ground truth (literally).

- I heard that parters don't offer as much to TDI graduates since they have to pay TDI a finder's fee?

I forgot where I read this (either here or Quora) but this isn't universally true. There is some truth to it particularly for start-ups and small outfits where resources are by definition limited. But for medium to large enterprises, a finder's fee is fairly typical in the industry and has really noting to do with a certain position's salary range.

- I got accepted as a Scholar. Should I try to reapply as a Fellow instead? And do I have a better chance of landing a job as a Fellow vs. a Scholar?

Honestly, if you can afford it, I would advocate that you just take the course. Also, TDI is heavily biased towards having a PhD for the tuition-free Fellowship program so if you only have a Master's degree keep that in mind.

As I said earlier, it's not more prestigious - everyone is a Fellow once you are admitted in the eyes of both the staff and perspective employers. It's simply a matter of cost.

- Is there a TDI Alumni network?

Unfortunately, no there isn't. Apparently, this has to do with their partner confidentiality agreements (at least that was my impression after inquiring).

6773,enrtsk,Data science in the public interest? Introducing the UIC Master of Science in Civic Analytics,,"Hello all,

I am posting to spread news of a new type of data science degree at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the [Master of Science in Civic Analytics (MSCA)](http://go.uic.edu/msca). The program is approved by the Illinois Board of Higher Education and is accepting applications for Fall 2020. The  degree is the first of its kind; merging advanced study in civic technology and data analytics into one curriculum.

The MSCA provides  preparation in principles of data science, including coding, statistics, data management, geospatial methods, and AI & machine learning, while being anchored  within public service, its problems, and ethics. The program  incorporates active involvement in the Chicago civic technology community through service learning, civic innovation and [hacktivism](https://chihacknight.org/).

The curriculum prepares students to assume positions as data/information officers, geospatial analysts, policy analysts, and program evaluators  in government agencies (city, state, federal) and nonprofits. Students may also find employment as specialists within government services contractors and consulting firms. Courses are taught by our highly-ranked college faculty, as well as leading practitioners in Chicago's civic technology community.

Please feel free to PM me with questions; I am happy to discuss the program, its curriculum, and Chicago's civic technology community.",,101,datascience

In a similar vein is A Modern Approach to Regression by Simon Sheather, which I think is quite good for building practical linear models, and really understanding when the model is appropriate. Anything else you've found useful in moving from theory to practice?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I guess the part that I really like about Sheather's book is that it takes one aspect of machine learning (linear models), and goes into a lot of practical details on it. APM goes has a broad overview of a number of models, and gives some practical information on them, but I don't feel like it goes that \*deep\* in the practical side. For example, I'd love to read a book on using gradient boosted trees if one existed, including topics such as where the models don't work well, how to tune the hyperparameters (beyond just hyperopt / gridsearch whatever). Maybe those types of books don't exist as much for models other than linear ones? A lot of these books seems like ""practical intro to data science"" which is great, but I imagine for someone with a more theoretical background ESL, there are a lot of redundancies. Are there any books that you'd consider ""advanced"" and also practical / example focused?",,94,datascience

We had a lot of success subsetting the data by level of measurement (nominal / continuous) and by the general process part (first order process, second order) BEFORE doing VIF. That was key. Then we put them all non vif offenders in a gbm. The variable importance was much clear after boosting. 

That narrowed down the variables to where we could run a reasonable fractional factorial with an L8 design. We even had room to assess some non confounded two way interactions. 

So I'm thinking based on that and other excellent points below that boosting is absolutely affected by multicolinearity regardless of caveats.

I've seen that one of the most tricky aspect of applying real data science outside of MOOCs, University and books in general, is the management of the dataset. In books you follow instructions of someone who know the dataset under consideration so there is no ""creative part"" or, in may opinion, it fails to communicate the way you should first step into a data set. I'm using R to perform the analysis, I have 81 features. What I've done so fare:

1. loaded the dataset into a data.frame. (easy task)
2. Started to look at the structure of the dataset by means of the str() function, to see what I'm dealing with.
3. Start to plot some variable with ggplot2, to see how these are distributed, and found immediately that there are some factors highly skewed toward a level. 

My question is how do you manage so many predictors? I mean 81 variables are no joke and I think that I shouldn't use all of them in the regression if I have no idea of what i'm doing with them. Should a run a simple regression with all predictors and the backward select predictors?

6800,ehytvt,In Defense of SAS,,"So don't get me wrong I hate SAS in general. I have a comp sci degree, have experience coding in many different languages, and get frustrated to no end every time I need to use SAS. I used to work at a job where I used R for 90% of my tasks and now work at a job where I use python for 90% of my tasks. But for all the shit it gets and the fact that it was coded in the 70s? It's still insanely fast and good at certain statistical tasks and medium-large sized data. I was working on a proof of concept to prove to my team python was much better and could replace SAS, and I was struggling. When dealing with small data python was much better, but who cares if you can do your work in 50ms compared to 200ms? When the data got bigger many of the tasks I was trying to replicate with python were so much slower that SAS was actually completing the task faster than python could even read the dataset into memory. I'm actually working on a project I can publish to a public github repo because I couldn't believe it. You would think python would shine with data that's slightly large but fits in memory, but SAS was actually winning this. When we started dealing with big data where python required dataset chunking SAS blew it out of the water performance-wise and obviously time to code-wise, since SAS required no modifications while python required much different code to handle chunks at a time.

  
Maybe there were some optimizations I could make with python to speed it up a bit, and I'm not saying SAS is not going to be obsolete in the next few years, I'm just saying I think a lot of data scientists hate on SAS without understanding the amount of genius that went into it. We're talking about software built in the 70s when large amounts of memory weren't a thing, and it still is out-performing state of the art data science programming software in 2019 for some use cases. I yearn for the day that's not the case and when real programming languages can replicate everything SAS can do, but the fact of the matter is the average r/datascience user scoffs at SAS while there are SAS users making way more money and performing data science tasks much faster and better than them. I much enjoy programming in R or python to SAS, but there are definitely things that SAS does much quicker than either language, which is amazing given the restrictions where it needs to store everything on the disk. Sure if you're an expert python coder you can probably optimize your work better than SAS, but if you're that skilled, you're probably a developer rather than a data scientist. SAS has incredibly fast operations given the flexibility it has and given the restraints of needing to work from the disk rather than memory, and if you're trying to maximize your value as a data scientist you're going to be focusing on things other than coding. If you're looking to be promoted as a data scientist today at a company that has SAS, R, and python, I think you're much more likely to be promoted by spending your time learning more AI/ML algorithms and implementing them in SAS than you are in spending that time optimizing an algorithm or process in R or python. Do you think your boss will be more impressed that you improved the model you own by lowering the adjusted R-squared and now your business can be more confident in its decision-making or will your boss be more impressed that you implemented the same model that's been running for a decade in an open-source programming language?

I always end up looking at different peoples notebooks to see the path they took and the code/steps they used. I never turn these in and they are mainly meant to practice, but I'm tired of always having to look at peoples ""solutions"" and methods instead of coming up with my own novel way from scratch or doing all the steps on my own.

I'm not sure what I am trying to say, but I just want to be able to do my own analysis without having to copy others or look at others work. I feel terrible since I'm stealing other peoples books, adding/changing a bit, and then combining things to make my notebook. I want to do the whole process on my own like everyone else.

Though my coding ability has increased, I want it to be higher. However, starting from today, I have made a pledge to never look at peoples solutions.

I am at a crossoads because I want to become a good data scientist but I have had difficulty learning it all on my own through online courses. I am an accountant with a CPA and two years of pure mathematics (multi-variable calculus, real analysis, linear algebra) before business school under my belt, but I am seriously lacking the statistics and computer science needed for data science. 

I want to dedicate my time fully to gaining the skills. From reading this site, it seems people have mixed reviews about a professional masters (Analytics, Data Science) and 12-week bootcamps. There seems to be higher praise for more academic degrees (Masters of Statistics or Computer Science). As I come from a pure math backround, the statistics one is very appealing.

My questions are, regarding a Masters in Statistics:

1. Does having a more academic degree, coming with all of the pure research, tuition costs, and courses that you will likely never apply in a job make it worth it because you are seen to know the math behind data science more deeply?
2. Do you actually learn the math deeper behind data science, and therefore actually become a better data scientist? Or do you specialize too much in a field in the masters and therefore would have to learn everything on the job anyway?
3. Even if you do a masters in stats, would you still need to learn all of the computer science on the side? Or would they typically offer you the comp sci courses as well?
4. It seems like even after all of your actual studies, you still need personal projects. Therefore, in a masters of stats, would you have had enough personal projects through your courses to put on a resume or a github? Or would this have to be on the side as well?

If anyone has any experience doing a masters in stats as a transition into data science, I would love to hear your personal experience as well, you can write here or PM me!

6815,b9gs0n,Was it Worth Studying a Data Science Masters? (My experience),,"Hi,

&#x200B;

Since completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending. Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course, what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following. I created this article for Medium but thought it would be good to post it here as well to help discussions as I often see questions about Data Science Masters and whether they are worth it. 

### Why did I choose to study Data¬†Science?

It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and I was gaining little to no coding experience.

It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.

However, as I started to apply for Data Science roles it quickly became apparent that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**

### What were my¬†options?

The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on a CV to employers.

I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and I was unsure of how repeating someone else‚Äôs work would be received by employers. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately, boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.

Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business schools, was far more expensive at over ¬£25,000 for one year of studying. The latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably less for the year at ¬£9,000 (for UK citizen).

### What did I¬†choose?

In the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning and develop my coding skills through project work.

Therefore, I joined the 2016/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University of London‚Äôs Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).

### What did I learn in the¬†course?

The first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects publicly](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2017/06/27/test/).

In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures. I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term‚Äôs module) and Software Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced text data and natural language processing.

Over the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation, we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working). I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/09/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations/).

### Did I gain the skills I needed from the¬†course?

I had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear ‚Äòbox tick‚Äô against these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.

The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.

### What advice would I give to someone considering moving into Data¬†Science?

This is always a hard question for me to answer as each person‚Äôs position is different so will try to offer some advice based on my experience. In short:

1. **Establish** that Data Science is the right route for you and find a topic or detail to motivate this. For me, it was the ability to apply data analytics in a creative way and become a valuable asset in a business to help others improve their decisions.
2. **Evaluate** what the jobs you want are asking for and where your set of skills currently fall short. Although I had the technical background, I had not demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning or code and needed something to achieve this. For others on my course, they had not come from maths or stats backgrounds and so needed these to strengthen their knowledge.
3. **Review** the options available to you to gain these missing skills. For example, boot camps are increasingly more credible in the industry but they are often following a single path (i.e. learn on the same data and apply the same methods). This may work for some but I wanted to demonstrate my abilities in unique ways to stand out to employers. If you are considering a masters, thoroughly research the modules and who is organising the course as variations will exists between different departments, particularly business and academic schools.
4. **Expand and challenge** yourself through the course, don‚Äôt simply pick a course that covers topics you are already comfortable with to tick a box. Find something challenging that will encourage you to develop new skills.
5. **Demonstrate** your new skills by publishing your projects online, either through GitHub or Kaggle or your own site. Building a portfolio of project has taken me further in any interview than trying to describe these within the time limit would allow.

I hope you find this post useful if you are considering how to get into data science and will do my best to answer any questions you have about this. Am UK time so will most likely reply to questions tomorrow morning when I have some time.

6819,7vrudq,People who say you can get a data science without a grad degree are doing a massive disservice.,,"I'm getting really tired and frustrated of hearing some folks (especially big-name data people on twitter) who try to reassure people like me that it is possible to get a job in data science without a grad degree. 

I graduated from a boot camp two years ago and I've applied to hundreds of entry-level data scientist and data analyst jobs with no luck. I currently work three different contract jobs. In one of my jobs, I work as an online mentor, which means I'm qualified to teach the stuff but not qualified to work in this field. 

I made 28k last year and because I only do 1099 work, I'm facing a huge tax bill in a couple months. Yeah I know I should've been paying estimated taxes along the way, but that's hard to do when you have $400/month boot camp loan payment.

I've done the networking thing to death. I've hit up my friend's sister's boyfriends and my friend's tinder date for coffee and nothing has come from that.

I'm constantly working on improving my skills and publishing work, but nothing is coming from that. I've had professional data scientists tell me they're stumped as to why I can't get work.

So I guess this means that I need to go grad school and go further into debt. Let's say I choose to do a masters, how do I know the job market won't be stacked in favor of PhDs? 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point, my motivation to do my current jobs is eroding and it's affecting my performance at work.

At this point, all I want is an internship, but that is pretty much impossible because all those positions require you to be in school.

Maybe I'm just bitter and I need to rant, but if there are pieces of wisdom you can spare, I would greatly appreciate them.

EDIT: I honestly did not expect this to receive as many responses as it did. I greatly appreciate the quantity and quality of feedback, including the more critical ones as well. I'm going to try to keep responding to more of your messages.",,97,datascience

I simply feel like I don't know enough, and that I never will.. At the same time, I find the work very rewarding and technically interesting, and I definitely want to stay in the field. This leads to the realization that if I am to stay in the field, I should find ways to deal with this discomfort. Maybe you guys can help me..

I have a background in aerospace engineering, and got into the field by basically doing self study (understanding the math behind most basic algorithms, applying them to Kaggle problems, and getting as good as possible in Python). I interned as a data scientist where I basically did nothing academic (sort of a real-life Kaggle competition to be honest), and through some luck ended up in the position I am in now.

Fueled by imposter syndrome, I tend to spend most of my free time (weekends mainly) doing self study and trying to learn more. I am not doing this because I **have** to, I am genuinely interested in the field. However, it feels like there is so much to learn and it is starting to get to me.

To give some context, I have never done anything related to neural networks. I kind of know how it works on a high level and I know what backpropagation is and the math behind it, but I have never actually coded up any sort of deep learning model. I am definitely not comfortable in using it in my daily work.

I also don't know anything about Bayesian statistics. I have spent the last week or so going through numerous sources and am now comfortable with the idea of priors, likelihood functions, how to update the posterior, and various ways of finding the posterior (grid approximation/quadrature/MCMC). But again, I have never actually used it so I don't feel like I actually am capable of using it in my day-to-day work.

Just today I learned about the existence of Generalized Linear Models, and it is as if suddenly I am confronted with yet another beast which I had no idea existed. But guess what: if I truly want to be a good at what I do and be a master in my field, I have to learn this as well. And at this point, I don't even really know what it means.

I guess my general question is: how do you guys deal with this situation? There are seemingly infinite things to learn about, and then each of those things can be learned to an arbitrary level of detail. How do you pick what to learn/focus on, and how do you decide that ""enough is enough?"".

For something like the Gradient Descent, I understand that it works by minimizing the error by looking at the gradient and finding the local (global if lucky) minima, but if I had to code implementations to the SVD or Gradient Descent from scratch, I'm not sure I could do it, so I thought I would pose the question in the title to the seasoned veterans.",,94,datascience
6824,bshbf9,Creative ways to collect/label your data,,"IMO, the best skill a data scientist can have is creative thinking. It especially strikes me when it comes to collecting data.

I can see if you are developing in C++ where the build process has been an unstandardized mess for decades: Docker containers could be a true life preserver. But in Python we have had virtual environments for many years:I send someone my environment specification, and they create the environment, and *voila*! Things just work.

These tasks are often somewhat unstructured. We have no ""hub"" to keep track of everything, save for some powerpoints and excel files where we try to update status.

I originally became interested in data science because I was fascinated with the ability to leverage data to surface insights and uncover truths that could drive real-world decision-making and impact. I find much of ML, on the other hand, to be tweaking models and fiddling with things to get those couple of points more of accuracy. It doesn‚Äôt feel much like uncovering truth and communicating insights at all. It feels similar to tuning up a car.  

I was wondering what paths are available for more insights-driven data science. It seems that ML is all the rage and all the jobs/internships out there are for that. I‚Äôm not sure how to tailor my education or look for roles outside of this realm.",,86,datascience

Realistically if I was working 8 hrs a day I probably could‚Äôve finished in a week or so. Do I need to just keep practicing and getting faster or am I rushing?",,88,datascience

&#x200B;

Domain expert here, converted over to doing predictive modeling. My software engineering skills are poor, at best. I want to learn how to write production grade code that is versioned etc., and simulate putting models into production. Best way to do this would obviously be on the job, but unfortunately that is not a possibility right now.

&#x200B;

What MOOCs, resources, tutorials would you recommend to start?  What about setting up pipelines and putting a model into production in miniature? The goal would be to get some background knowledge and to actually use it to do some projects at home that I can have in my portfolio.

I recently just began my first job as a data scientist at a smaller, market research company. One of the things I'm quickly realizing the importance of is the ability to communicate your data science work to other non-technical people. There seems to be a coveted middle ground where one can express ideas and concepts clearly, without getting to into the weeds with things or sounding like you're showing off.

After about 5 months of working here, one of my biggest struggles has been being able to validate if the underlying data seems to look correct. I do a lot of query writing with SQL and get my queries validated from time to time but there appears to be inconsistencies between what my boss expects the results to be and what they are. I am one of the only ones at my company doing this and there isn't always a clear point of truth. 

I understand that data validation and accuracy is an integral part of this industry, but I feel very overwhelmed with the expectations at times. I feel as though I am a bit more junior for my role. Is this a normal feeling for an entry level candidate?

My boss is not happy with the inconsistencies and I feel that I am going to be let off soon simply because I haven't delivered up to his high expectations. I definitely want to improve but I just don't know what more I can do. I really enjoy working with data but feel lost and frustrated at times by the lack of clarity.

6865,4n8r42,Feeling discouraged about my data science job,,"My job title is ""data scientist."" I work at a moderately successful small company. I make an excellent salary (over 100k). I get to interact with everyone at the company, from top-level management to low-level employees. I'm well-respected, and people listen to what I say.

But I hate my job. The more I examine common practices at my company, the more I realize that everything is a lie. We sell models to clients, but they don't work, and they never have. Top-level management is excellent at selling promises to clients that we can't actually deliver. Given that we work in a specialized field that's currently experiencing a bubble, none of our clients seem to have noticed yet. But they will.

I'm realizing how little I know about statistics. The more I learn, the more problems I see across the entire company- hundreds of little, seemingly innocuous technical mistakes that culminate in completely worthless models. And I'm supposed to be the expert. I am slowly fixing what I can, but it is an absolutely daunting task. All the while, outwardly pretending to have absolute confidence, or else it feels like everything will come crashing to the ground.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else feels the same way. I'm doing a piss-poor job at being a ""data scientist"", and the worst part is that I'm not even sure I'm learning how to be better. Should I leave my current company and find one that implements ""best practices"", whatever that means? Should I try to fix the problems at my current company and learn as much as I can in the process?

6866,dni47i,does anyone else notice this happening with data science where you work,,"&#x200B;

So, I currently work in business intelligence with a team of about 15 people and we support many departments in the company. About 8 or 9 months ago, the word came down from the top that DATA SCIENCE was going to be the hip new thing that everyone in BI was going to learn and master to help push the business forward. The idea was to create bootcamps led by senior data scientists to help develop new data scientists. Our leaders have been pushing managers to encourage us to go into these programs, but i've been pushing back big time saying a bootcamp is not going to work because it takes years to master these skills needed to be a good data scientist. I did have a chance to speak with the project manager and a couple leads in the program and I asked how important math was in this program and the response I got was you just need to know Stats 101 and you should be fine. I had asked about linear algebra and I got kind of a little bit of silence on the phone and someone said you don't need to know math at that level. Is it normal for companies to underestimate how much work is actually required to do data science? I mean, the math alone is some serious stuff. From what I could gather, a lot of the program is geared towards learning to write the code in python using existing models, tuning those models, but not really getting deep enough to understand all the math going on in the background. Isn't this kind of dangerous to make predictions of data without understanding all of the math going on in the background?",,88,datascience

6869,8t000k,Lost in Data Science,,"So I've been working as a Data Scientist for nearly 4 years. I've studied a vague bachelor's which touches ground on economics, statistics, and quite a bit of programming involved. That led me to be the sort of Data Scientist which can get quite a bit of the programming parts, quite a bit of the statistics but never felt comfortable or confident enough there, and not enough programming experience to setup Spark clusters myself (although I did manage to do it with a bit of head bashing against the wall for an interview). 

I think I'm trying to figure out what my next step should be. I quit my job to have a few months off, and thought about building a bit of a portfolio. I've been working only in startups until now, which led me to be pretty close to management. It makes me wonder if I should consider moving further into leadership, or just focus on improving my skills. I always hated leaders which don't know what they're doing, but after seeing a few jobs I had, it feels like it's more important to know how to deal with different stakeholders and politics, rather than your raw knowledge. 


Would it make more sense to do a masters? Would real life jobs be still a better idea? Is it even worth having a portfolio except for my own confidence boost? What should the role of a Data Scientist be anyway? I think i'm just looking for my job to mean more than number crunching and ETL making and sometimes better decision making just because I know some stats. 

Tl;dr: a bit lost in my Data Science career, wondering if this is all to it or what exactly should it be about.

Customers can use any channel to change their plan - web, app, call care support, chat with an agent, visit store etc. I am looking for a way to measure pain in their journey while changing plans - how much time did it take to browse plans and make a choice, was the app experience so bad that the customer had to call care center, were there any wrong expectations set or miscommunication that made the customer call back care after the change (issues with billing, device etc)

One way I thought made sense would be to use CSAT score, find correlation with features like time spent, number of calls or visits, number of times channels was switched, and try to come up with a way to quantify the pain experienced in each step.

I was pumped when I transitioned from being a software developer in my old job to a data scientist/data analyst in my current job about 6 months ago. I went into this new company thinking (hoping) that I'd spend most of my 8 hours in the office deeply in thought writing code, building models, doing EDA and digging up insights from data, since this is what I'm good at.

Little did I know that most of my time would be spent dealing with people's unrealistic expectations, ridiculous deadlines, attending hour-long meetings and calls to discuss things that could have been easily communicated over email. And of course, making effing power point presentations about the work my team is doing.  Not to mention soliciting data from multiple internal teams within the company, which is mostly stored and shared in Excel files with no proper documentation.

I'm not good at it. I'm pretty introverted by nature and doing all this stuff drains a lot of my energy. 
And on the rare occasions when I sit down and get in the zone to carve out that beautiful block of code, something else turns up that demands immediate attention. So I have to dump whatever I'm doing at the time and pick up that other task, because it's the ""priority"" because the business/sales guys have promised some other people on our behalf.

The company is kind of a startup. I've talked with people higher in the hierarchy about streamlining processes of acquiring, storing data. Introducing a middle layer between the sales and data science team. But all I got in response was that it's a fast growing company and stuff like this is normal. I gotta adapt. 

To be honest I had a totally different idea of a data science job. To the people who're working as data scientists, is this normal? What's your day to day job like?

**Edit 2:**

Dear me. This exploded overnight and I've got so many replies. I've read all so far, apologies that i can't respond to everyone.

It seems I should have provided some more context about my profile, since people are making a lot of assumptions and this has turned into a ""social skills"" debate rather than a ""separation of duties"" debate.

Firstly about my role: 
We are a team of 3 people, each working on a separate project which are not related. So actually it's like a one man army thing with occasional helping hands from the other two. 

Requirements stated in the job description when i applied:

1) experience in statistical modeling

2) machine learning

3) Big data technologies like apache spark

4) Python, R

The stated requirement was **not at all** of a manager's role.

Of course i understand that data science cannot be done in silos without taking inputs from other people. I'm totally fine with making calls and meetings when they are actually productive. They're not half the times. And since we're working independently, I don't get enough time to do the work I was actually hired to do. Which results in 12 - 13 hour workdays which totally exhausts me.

As for my social skills, they're fine insofar as work is concerned. I'm able to communicate clearly and to the point to the person in meetings. It's just that this consumes too much of my time and leaves me exhausted to do the actual work of processing data.",,83,datascience

6884,6yklj6,My Experience as a Data Analyst Intern,,"**About Me**

I am currently a candidate for a MSc in Data Science. I started the program today and it is a two-year program.

This past summer I was hired as a Data Analyst Intern at a startup. Although I was not officially Data Scientist Intern, I did do some machine learning while on the job and implemented algorithms at various points. I don't think there is much difference between a Data Analyst Internship and a Data Scientist Internship **within a tech startup**. I do not know how data analyst interns operate in accounting firms, banks, etc.

**The Interview**

After a phone screening, I was invited to interview at the office. The first part was a behavioral interview with the Data Team Lead. The second part was a technical interview with the Data Scientist. 

Q1: Explain one of your projects on your resume to me as if I am a client.

A: The best way to answer this question is to be as vague as possible. Clients/non-engineering members don't care about the algorithm you used or the results of the confusion matrix. What they do care about is how these results will affect their profits or their company in general. Don't talk about the decision tree implementation, talk about how the significant factors you found that led to the classification of the predicted value.

Q2: Design a retail/book/grocery store relational database

A2: Basically you want a table of all the transactions, the items and their prices, customers, each with keys that can join to the other table. I was also asked to limit the tables, join the tables, order a table and group by a table. We ran out of time, but the next part was CTEs.

**The Internship**

As an intern I was asked to do a variety of things. However, my most used skill while at my internship was web-scraping. I developed scripts to scrape websites for a variety of information needed to make the company's current information more useful. If you do not know how to web scrape, I highly suggest you learn it. I personally use BeautifulSoup.

The data team was very small so I had the opportunity to work on all types of projects, including working with PDF and free text data. Therefore, I also learned how to work with unstructured data. This is a pretty daunting task and if you ever end up having to work with this form of data, I highly recommend keeping your bosses in the loop. I didn't and finished it with only a day to spare which was not ideal. 

I also worked with the data scientist to productionalize and augment the current models. While the data scientist worked on more pressing matters, I was testing different algorithms and examining outputs in forms such as confusion matrices, lift charts, AUC curves, etc. 

**Conclusion**
Overall, I found this experience enjoyable. Although working at big 4 companies is ideal, I think working at start ups in big cities like New York, Boston, Silicon Valley, etc. is also super valuable. Being on a small team gave me some more responsibility than an intern would get and although none of the work I did was critical, it still provided value and left me in good terms with the employer.

If there was anything anyone else wanted to know that won't remove the anonymity of the company. Please ask. I saw some questions about people asking about data science internships an I wanted to give my two cents about my own ""data science"" internship.

* 1 year machine learning team lead at a startup
* 1 year backend engineer at a recently acquired and now large tech company which I‚Äôm trying to get out of

Problem is, my experience is a bit scattered and my career goals are to maximise my salary before the tech bubble bursts lol.

* my engineering experience is only ‚Äúlevel 4‚Äù by big tech standards due to lack of large scale cross-team projects, (which is hard on my ego due to the fact that I‚Äôm quite a bit older thanks to grad school)
* I don‚Äôt have enough leadership experience for most manager jobs (and I‚Äôm not sure I want to be a pure manager)
* I can‚Äôt get a senior DS job since I seem to always fumble stats questions, maybe due to never studying it formally ... I know I can work things out as I need them, but I don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äúright‚Äù answers are in interviews. 

My favourite job by far was at the startup which was a great mix of management, DS and engineering, so part of me just wants to try and find another good startup. But I also want to invest wisely in my career.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to take some stats courses and/or stick it out in big tech backend engineering to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù? Or do I have enough experience already to make it as a generalist in a startup or consulting?",,84,datascience

What about the job -- salary, work environment, culture, tools -- makes it a dream job?",,85,datascience
6893,bapmww,"Those working in Japan, can you tell me about your job?",,"I just wanted to hear what your day to day is like if you work in Japan in any kind of role involving data.  
In particular if you could answer some of these that'd be great :)

\- What kind of role are you in?  
\- What programs do you often use?  
\- Where in Japan do you work?  
\- What (spoken...) language/s do you work in?  
*If you work in English + Japanese:*  
\- can you describe when you use Japanese most?  
\- What was it like when you first started working in Japanese, be it at this job or a previous one.  
\- How would you rate your Japanese when you started vs now?  
\- How do the expectations vs reality stack up?  


MY SITUATION  
Male mid 20's, thinking of living with my Japanese girlfriend in Tokyo after I wrap up university. Nearly done a bachelor of economics and soon starting a 2 year master of stats here in Australia.  
Keen interest in data and using my communication skills to bridge the gap between business and tech to solve challenging problems, though I'm skeptical I could work like this in Japan.

  
I've got JLPT N2 and am comfortable *recognising* 1200 or so Kanji. Everyday conversation is no problem, outside of that I'm in trouble. My reading sucks outside of everyday conversation, so I'd need to improve that drastically + learn keigo and lots of vocabulary to work in Japanese (plus more perhaps?)  
I know there aren't many data related positions in english only, but the idea of working in Japanese makes me nervous. It's a huge time commitment learning that much Japanese; plus I couldn't stand working at any of the more traditional companies with rigid constraints and inefficiencies everywhere. Not to mention overtime at most of those companies.

  
Anyway, just wanted to put the feelers out and ask how others are finding it.",,83,datascience

I'm currently taking some pretty intense DS courses with emphasis on non-numeric data types and non-traditional data structures. I go to a public university that has a pretty phenomenal data science faculty. I'm sorta curious as to how I can combine these things, and how people do that in the ""real world"".",,84,datascience

6896,7xz6j8,The math part of data science,,"I took a couple of electives during my MBA that focuses on using r and it turns out I love it. I applied myself at work and with my professor's help created a term project that our CEO liked and I got moved into a brand new department that evaluates company processes and data. I've done pretty well in identifying problems and creating useable proposals for fixing them using R.

About 2 hours of my day, according to my job description, is to be dedicated to self education so I can continue to grow and be an asset. I started into python, jupyter notebook, tensor flow, and all the other good stuff that goes with it and I generally understand using it.

Here's the issue! I kind of struggled through stats in school but I understand the concept from reading books like ""R In Action"" and some other Manning publication and O'Reilly publication books. Most books give a conceptual view of stats now because they indicate nobody uses the math knowledge since they're just plugging into software anyway. I want to learn the math! I'm on a tight budget but I want to understand the Greek notation, learn the formulas, and really get down to the foundation of stats. Is there anything out there other than Kahn academy that actually teaches the math part?",,86,datascience
