0,Do we know of any diseases dinosaurs could have been infected with?,2,hcxfcd,askscience,0,"I get that paleontology doesn't get much in the way of soft tissue or the ability to look at micro organisms, but I thought I'd ask.

Maybe some of the same diseases that birds get today?"
1,Do all animals have an internal compass? How does it work? How come humans don't have this ability?,4,hcqbk1,askscience,3,Always wondered how birds and fish never got lost whike migrating. Anyone know why?
2,Does a plane have to slow down after dropping a payload?,1,hcplk2,askscience,4,"If a plane drops a heavy payload while in flight (nuclear bomb? idk), wouldn't a sudden imbalance in the forces propel the plane up suddenly? Then does the plane have to decelerate suddenly?"
3,What causes the rotational speeds of planets to differ so greatly?,3,hcpqvw,askscience,7,"I noticed that the rotational speeds of planets vary greatly as they get further from the Sun. Venus takes 243 days to complete one rotation while Jupiter only takes 9 hours. 

What are the factors that influence rotational speed of planets and why does it differ so much between the inner planets and the outer planets?"
4,"We have active cancer cells in labs that have been grown since the 50s and don't experience senescence, would it be possible to utilise this 'immortality' to grow organs?",3,hcpzjo,askscience,12,
5,"How many years after the last reported ""wild"" polio case, will polio be declared to be eradicated the way smallpox is?",4,hcq9qw,askscience,1,
6,"If someone can have COVID19 symptoms for months, can they be asymptomatic or mild symptoms for months too?",1,hcqf6a,askscience,2,"I'm reading lately about how some patients are in hospital for months, either needing oxygen for months, or ventilation. Is it possible for people to not have symptoms, or mild symptoms for months and be able to transmit it?"
7,Do organs ever get re-donated?,6343,hco00a,askscience,305,"Basically, if an organ transplant recipient dies, can the transplanted organ be used by a third person?"
8,What is the mechanism behind the rate of Radioactive Decay?,48,hcntrj,askscience,38," 

I was taught that after one half-life period, one half of the initial mass will break down. But when I asked why doesn’t it consistently decays, meaning after 2 half-lives, all of the matter will be gone, my teacher didn't give an appropriate answer and I had to take that for granted.

What is the mechanism behind Radioactive decay that makes it works that way? Why does the presence of more radioactive matter causes more atoms to decay?"
9,"What is a ""Cardiac filament""?",2,hc9mgn,askscience,2,"I was reading a bit in the famous *Gray’s Anatomy* about some functions of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve’s unusually long pathway. One section says:  “As the recurrent laryngeal nerve curves around the subclavian artery or the arch of aorta, it gives several cardiac filaments to the deep part of the cardiac plexus (*Gray's Anatomy*, 1980, p. 1081). I've tried to find out what exactly that means, but I'm struggling to understand what ""cardiac filaments"" are. Any help would be most appreciated."
10,What causes shingles (and the zoster virus in general) to manifest as a rash?,20,hcmje5,askscience,15,"Shingles is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. In searching online, I haven’t been able to find out what triggers the virus to exhibit a painful rash with blisters. Why is it a rash instead of, say, a sore throat?"
11,I read that a 2011 earthquake in japan shifted the axis of the earth. Are there other events that did this?,16,hckiqn,askscience,10,The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs is my main question but felt that was too specific.
12,Why are smartphones cameras so small?,3,hcbneu,askscience,2,"As I understand, the bigger the sensor, the more light goes in and the better a image is. So, why must smartphone cameras be so small? There is plenty of space on the back"
13,How does the standard model of particle physics explain Newton's laws of motion?,50,hckfpk,askscience,8,"The way I understand it, the standard model of particle physics describes four fundamental interactions: electromagnetism, gravity, the strong force, and the weak nuclear force, gravity being unexplained in specific terms. Where then does Newton's ""F"" in F=ma come from (in particular the ""applied force""), and why does it act upon aggregates of particles according to the Newtonian laws of motion?"
14,Can an individual be continuously reinfected by a virus?,12,hce1i7,askscience,10,"For example, if I have a bad cold and am sitting in my room all day retouching the same objects over and over, am I continuously reinfecting myself (or ""erasing"" my body's progress of fighting it) by taking in more of the virus?"
15,Are the chances of multiple vaccine prospects for COVID-19 working correlated or independent?,1,hcegwr,askscience,3,"The NY Times is tracking the number of COVID-19 vaccines in each phase of human trials. If one of these vaccines fails does that mean others are more likely to fail as well, perhaps due to some underlying trait of the disease, or are these independent rolls of the dice? Do we get more information from a failed trial about if other vaccine prospects are likely to work?"
16,How can someone be asymptomatic when having COVID-19?,1,hceofy,askscience,4,A detailed explanation...
17,"Assuming that coronavirus antibodies only last for a few months, what would this mean for immunity?",1,hcfngt,askscience,6,There was an article in r/science that said that there is evidence that COVID antibodies may only last for two to three months. Does this mean that your immunity would end after that time period if you had already caught the virus? Does that mean a potential vaccine would only be effective for a few months? How will this affect attempts to eliminate the virus in the future?
18,If 0’C = 32’F then does 0+0=64?,0,hcj5ct,askscience,10,
19,Do creatures with shorter lifespans evolve faster?,51,hccfcn,askscience,22,"Maybe I'm wrong with this but my (very) basic understanding of evolution is that there are genetic mutations in a species that ""win"" over vast amounts of time and change things as a result. So, if you have certain creatures that only live a few years, then wouldn't any mutations happen faster if they were far more generations to travel through?"
20,Why is there a high tide in the opposite side to the moon?,11,hc8cok,askscience,17,"It makes sense why there would be a high tide facing the moon, because the moon's gravity pulls the water. But why a high tide on the opposite tide, therefore 2 high tides a day?"
21,"Which is more efficient, high or low altitude flight?",14,hc3myj,askscience,9,"I know nothing about this but I was just considering air density and flight. I think low altitude has higher density air which would make more friction on a fuselage and slow an aircraft down BUT the engines would have more thrust/material to push. In very high altitude there would be less friction but also less air/material for the engines to push so they might have to work harder to go the same speed? I suspect that it might depend on what speed an aircraft wants to go. Also, getting to altitude might remove any efficiency advantage of high altitude flight.  Think Solar Impulse versus the X-15. Which is more efficient, very high or very low fight?"
22,"Can someone who has had Covid-19, and built up immunity, still spread the virus via respiratory droplets?",0,hc5npl,askscience,9,Let’s say you get exposed again after building immunity. Is there a period where the virus is able to spread before your immune system can kill it?
23,"Is carrying antibiotic resistance genes costly for bacteria? In other words, is there any selection pressure against having them?",15,hc73fp,askscience,12,
24,What exactly is the lymphatic system for and what are it’s evolutionary origins?,32,hc75oc,askscience,13,"I’ve always learned answers such as “it’s important for the immune system” and also that it aids in fat transport. However, it seems excessive to have a separate vessel system just for those purposes, when the circulatory system is generally adequate for most immune response and nutrient circulation. How did the lymphatic system evolve and remain present? Did it once hold greater importance? How bad would it be if someone didn’t have it?"
25,"If something bleaches, where does the colour go?",35,hc22md,askscience,9,"When something gets bleached, where does the colour go?
For example plastic toys or printed posters that lose their colour when exposed to the sun, as well as chemical bleached things such as hair or fabrics."
26,"How does the doppler effect not violate conservation of momentum? Is this a dark energy, negative vacuum pressure thing?",6,hc2flc,askscience,5,"Not a physics major.  Just watch a lot of Matt O'Dowd(👍).

Photon momentum is a function of frequency.  If a photon's 
frequency is different between two observers in receding galaxies, where did that momentum energy go?

Does it bleed into some fundamental field?
Does dark energy's stretching of spacetime warp the waveform?
Does it mean there really is a prime reference frame and photon energies are only observed to be different because of relativistic Doppler effects?"
27,Are there gemstones on the moon?,6399,hc06f9,askscience,408,"From my understanding, gemstones on Earth form from high pressure/temperature interactions of a variety of minerals, and in many cases water.

&#x200B;

I know the Moon used to be volcanic, and most theories describe it breaking off of Earth after a collision with a Mars-sized object, so I reckon it's made of more or less the same stuff as Earth. Could there be lunar Kimberlite pipes full of diamonds, or seams of metamorphic Tanzanite buried in the Maria?

28,How much did fishes adapt to fishing?,226,hby8jr,askscience,43,"We as humans practice fishing for a very long time, and very intensively recently, so I wonder how can fishes still got tricked by the hooks and baits (even though most of fishing today is not with that method) So, are there fish species that significantly changed their behavior in response to fishing? And which one?"
29,How fast could you go if you built a railgun straight through the Moon?,2,hbw3v9,askscience,7,If the Moon is 3500Km’s across and assuming that you had 200Gw available (1Gw nuclear plant every 100Kms with efficiency losses) and 1 ton of mass? How does this change at a limited acceleration of 10g? I think that you would get to a decent percentage of c but I don’t know what this would be.
30,can space really be called a vacuume?,4,hbxwk9,askscience,5,If i'm understanding solar wind correctly space shouldn't be considered a true vacuum right? what am i missing here?
31,How did covid-19 enter the first person to infect them?,1,hbtvul,askscience,5,"From what’s all understanding I have, it would be unlikely that the first case was from someone eating a bat.  Is it that maybe it comes from something else they had eaten that was infected?"
32,Does docking with the international space station affect its orbit?,7,hblbz3,askscience,4,I would imagine it would have to - what I'm really curious about is whether or not it is enough of an impact that an adjustment has to be made after docking in order to keep the ISS in a stable orbit
33,What mediates a salmon's ability to return to it's home river?,37,hbth40,askscience,16,"Is the instinct to return to their home river encoded in their DNA, or in their early memories? For example, if I took salmon eggs laid in river A and transplanted them in river B, which river would they return to?"
34,Does the engine placement on a plane affect how steep the plane can take off?,8,hbss0g,askscience,9,"I know there are a lot of factors involved in this such as the wind, weight of the plane, and the design of the plane itself but imagine two planes, one with engines on the tail (MD-80 series) vs. one with engines on the wings (737s or A320s), taking off at an identical takeoff situation. Which plane might be able to take off at a steeper angle?"
35,"Questions on Newton's 3rd law: when I push on a wall, how does it push back on me? I just don't understand what is happening at the particle level when push a wall thar causes it to push back on me. Same goes with an object on a table, how does the table actually push back on the object?",19,hbpd0q,askscience,21,
36,"Plasmonic virus sensing: Seriously, why isn’t this more common?",1,hbp2a3,askscience,2,"This technique has been around since about 2010 ([source](https://physicsworld.com/a/plasmonic-sensor-detects-viruses/)) and has seen publications in ACS as recently as April ([source](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c02439)). As someone who has colleagues working on similar techniques, why haven't I seen anything about this being applied in practice?"
37,Why do people vomit from drinking banana and sprite?,5,hbli1i,askscience,3,
38,"Since heat transfer is caused by random collision of particles, is it mathematically possible that your hand could touch a hot pan and you actually heat up the pan with your hand?",24,hbkera,askscience,20,"I know the probability of this would be inconceivably small so it would never actually happen, but is it mathematically possible that: because heat transfer is based on random collisions of particles, all the hot particles just so happen to bounce from your hand to a hot so that the net heat transfer is positive? This would mean that instead of the pan heating up your hand, your hand transfers even more heat to the pan.

Sorry if I'm misunderstanding physics, just a fun question I thought of."
39,"What kingdom or domain of life are viruses in, and what differentiates them specifically from other single-cell organisms like bacteria?",13,hbjnga,askscience,22,I was doing some reading for fun on this and I can't find them anywhere in the Taxonomy wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology) page
40,Why are Irradiated Objects Radioactive for so Long??,8,hbefvq,askscience,4,"I’m watching the Chernobyl docuseries for the first time and am not fully grasping the concept of radiation exposure. 

It seems that a lot of the land around Chernobyl has seen reduced radiation over time to where tourists can come and visit the area (for limited periods of time). 

But the Pripyat Hospital basement is still incredibly dangerous from the piles of engineer and fireman clothes who were working that night some 30+ years ago. 

There are even videos on YouTube - https://youtu.be/pzjtJNu-jYM - of people touring the basement with Geiger counters, showing the radiation being emitted from those items. 

Please explain to me like I’m a 6 year old:

- Why/how do irradiated objects then themselves emit their own radiation? (if that is even what is happening)
- Why are objects/soil on the surface (that were in close proximity to the core explosion) seemingly “safer” 30+ years later, while worker’s clothes are still dangerous?
- Is there a simple way to explain radiation and its effects in high doses (more so on objects than people)?

Thank you."
41,"If gravity propagates non-instantly, does that mean planets are being pulled to where the sun *was* a small time ago?",21,hbfqlc,askscience,10,"If so, since the sun is moving extremely quickly through the galaxy, why doesn’t it eventually lose its planets as they’re in a sense being attracted to a point pretty far “behind” where it currently is?"
42,"Are there any ""living clades"" (2 or more species whose last common ancestor is not extinct)?",20,hbd7cz,askscience,6,"I can't think of any... it could happen, right?

Oh and ""living clade"" is apparently a meaninglyes term that I've just made up, which is probably why I can't google it! And maybe I'm using it wrong anyway, unless I'm also going to insist that ALL the descendents of the last common ancestor are still with us. I would settle for any pair of distinct species who share a common ancestor that is not extinct."
43,Why is it easier to hold your balance on a bicycle going fast than a bicycle going slowly?,7,hbgnw0,askscience,11,"When you are going a down a hill - you gain a lot of momentum, why is it that when in a state of higher momentum the chances of you falling off are considerably less because it’s much easier to hold your balance than it is going at a slower pace: why is this?"
44,When does a human become capable of recognizing their own reflection?,59,hbgzjc,askscience,17,"As the question suggests, I’m just curious on how and when a person starts to recognize themselves in a mirror, and how does it compare to animals, for example?"
45,"Crows are all over the world, but where are crows naturally from and what kind of effect did they have as an invasive species?",7977,hbfxg7,askscience,877,"A short time ago I saw an eagle flying around and I was in awe of it's beauty because it's such a rare sight here, but then a murder of crows started chasing after him and eventually wore him out and got him. 

Then I started to wonder how eagles even exist if 6 crowd can so easily take one down, and there are so many crows around.

I think I heard once that ravens are originally from Northern America and that they've been spiritual animals for some Native American cultures, but I could be wrong about that. 

So could it be that crows have only been in Europe and Asia for a couple hundreds of years? If so, how devastating was their arrival to the local bird population and other animals?"
46,Earth’s escape velocity is 11 km/s. What happens if we are slower than that?,0,hb6zse,askscience,10,Why can’t a craft slower than that escape earth’s gravity. What happens if we try?

48,"Why exactly do we ever need to assume the Axiom of Choice, if it doesn't even tell us how to construct the relevant sets? What practical results need this axiom?",9,hbcg45,askscience,22,
49,Is there any way to know what the Earth's rotational speed might have been prior to the collision with Theia that is theorized to have formed the Moon? And is there any chance the Earth ever experienced tidal locking/synchronous rotation with the Sun?,16,hb1tdt,askscience,6,I've seen writing that suggests that the Theia may have significantly increased the speed of the earth's rotation. Is there any chance that the Earth was ever tidally locked to the Sun before that collision?  Do models of the collision include an ability to estimate the earth's angular velocity prior to impact?
50,Is there a minimum or maximum limit to the wavelength of gravitational waves? What kind of gravitational interactions could these correspond to?,3,hayjot,askscience,3,
51,"When was the concept of ""zero gravity"" in space discovered, and was it immediately related to mass?",9,haval7,askscience,15,"Perhaps this is a melding of r/askscience and r/askhistory, but I was curious when the concept of Zero-G, or microgravity, came to be discovered or understood, and whether it was immediately correlated with the presence of mass."
52,What's the Difference Between Receptors and Transporters?,2,hav2ck,askscience,3,"I've been looking into the mechanism of actions of psychiatric medication and have found they primarily affect neurotransmitter transporters such as DAT, NET, and SERT. I've also found some psychiatric medication affect serotonin receptors like 5-HT1, adrenergic receptors, and dopamine receptors like D2 and D3. 

**What's the difference between monoamine transporters and receptors? How do some medications only affect receptors and not transporters? What functions do receptors fulfill that transporters do not?**"
53,Why is random noise incompressible?,3,hasgml,askscience,23,"I was looking up whether it is possible to have an incompressible sequence. I came across this post in which people are saying that random noise is incompressible: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9185289/uncompressable-data-sequence

&nbsp;

However, if I came up with a random sequence of numbers I would be able to encode the data in fewer bits by recognising patterns in the data, say multiple 1s or 0s in a row. My compression algorithm could record this section of data as 'n' number of zeros, instead of writing them all out."
54,"How do we determine the ""handedness"" of a race track?",3,haqy7s,askscience,4,"When going out for a bike ride on the roads, it's usually better to pick a clockwise loop to minimize the number of left-hand turns. However, riding my bike on the local F1 track ([Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve)) got me wondering how we would determine the handedness of a closed loop like a racetrack. Is it about the number of turns? About how long you go in a given direction? I would assume that this is greatly affected if the race track crosses itself too?"
55,Would a satellite in high earth orbit eventually crash into Earth due to the Moon affecting its orbit?,3,hap0i4,askscience,7,"Assuming we send a satelite in a high Earth circular orbit, like 50/50 between Earth and the Moon (let's assume the apoapsis is on the closest approach to the Moon, to make describing easier) . 

The satellite will be accelerated prograde and radial out, when it's on the way to its apoapsis. This would raise the apoapsis (and the periapsis slightly, due to increased velocity?), but also accelerate retrograde and radial out, when the satelite passed the apoapsis (which would lower the periapsis again?). So the net energy wouldn't change, but due to the radial out acceleration, the orbit will have a slight bulge on the Moon side and therfore a lower periapsis. 

Would this effect increase with each orbit, resulting in the satelite crashing into Earth again (while slightly rotating the apoapsis with the Moon's orbit) ?

Or would the apoapsis and periapsis stay the same and the elliptic orbit just rotates around with the Moon?

TL:DR basically the question in the title"
56,How quickly does a person infected with a virus become infectious themselves?,27,hb1t5i,askscience,9,"Current times got me thinking... If there were a stadium with 50,000 people in attendance for 2 hours and one of them had a virus and was infectious, presumably that person would infect a number of people around them. But how quickly would those newly infected people become infectious themselves? By the end of the 2 hours, how many of the 50,000 would we expect to be infected?"
57,How does sonar work?,7,hb1kz6,askscience,14,"I get that sonar is a device that emits sound waves and then collects their reflection and records the time taken in order to calculate the distance an object is from the source, but how does the device ensure that it will collect the sound wave upon reflection. For example if there was a smooth plane in front of the emitter, only a couple sound waves would return to the emitter upon reflection. Also how does a sonar distinguish one emitted wave from another?"
58,How do almost extinct species revive without the damaging effects of inbreeding?,6045,hayior,askscience,429,"I've heard a few stories about how some species have been brought back to vibrancy despite the population of the species being very low, sometimes down to the double digits. If the number of remaining animals in a species decreases to these dramatically low numbers, how do scientists prevent the very small remaining gene pool from being damaged by inbreeding when revitalizing the population?"
59,When ice is melting on thin water why does it rotate slowly?,11,hauyz4,askscience,6,"Example is here: [link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBiwatuFW9R/?igshid=ii0og8kd7i77)

For some reason, it just doesn't sit still while melting, and something causes it to spin ever so slowly."

61,How does a polarizing light microscope work?,3,haxr6x,askscience,2,I understand how the polarization works. I’m more confused on the ordinary/extraordinary waves that are produced after the plane polarized light passes through the material. (Side question: I still can’t wrap my head around isotropy/anisotropy if someone could also explain that.) I don’t understand how the second polar causes the extra/ordinary waves to create the vibrant colors in PLM or how rotating the stage causes the visible wavelength to cycle. Thank you in advance.
62,Did the nuclear bomb (testing) and the subsequent increase in background radiation levels lead to an increase in cancer?,11,hax8eu,askscience,18,"I found out today that some experiments require low-background steel, i.e. steel forged before the nuclear bomb, as steel forged after this period is contaminated with airborne radionuclides.   This led me to wonder whether the increase in background radiation had an appreciable effect on cancer rates in the global population, but I couldn't find any information on this."
63,What does it mean when people say “knotted muscle” or “tight muscle”? How does a muscle get knotted or tight?,19,hab9vp,askscience,0,
64,Does severity of infection affect a person’s ability to donate convalescent plasma?,2,havc28,askscience,3,"I’ve just had a serological antibody test performed by my workplace for SARS-COV-2, despite never having shown symptoms for the illness. I had hoped to be able to donate plasma if I came up as positive, however in reading the donation guidelines for convalescent plasma however the criteria specifically state they require the donor to ‘have fully recovered from the infection and have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.’

I think I’m mostly getting hung up on the verbiage used but wanted to confirm: Does presence of antibodies in plasma itself act as confirmation that a person has experienced an infection?  If so, does the severity of that infection somehow affect the efficacy of donor plasma?"

76,Why do planetary gears rations not seem to follow the normal rear reduction rules?,0,hairfo,askscience,5,"No idea if this is the correct sub for this but I figure it cant hurt to ask.  I'm pretty good with physics and science IMO and I figured for fun I'd try to teach myself about planetary gearboxes because they're pretty cool and a bit more complicated than regular gears.

So I 3D printed a little gear I made with a 60 tooth ring gear, with a 30 tooth sun gear and two 15 tooth planet gears.  When you do the math for this particular gearbox (using equations I found online), it says for one full rotation of the sun gear, the planets should move about 1/3 of the way around the circle, essentially a 3:1 reduction, and this is how it works with the model I printed; but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around where the 3 comes from.

I would think that if I spin the sun gear one full rotation (30 teeth) it would force the planets to also spin a distance of 30 teeth, or half way around the circle.  But when you look up close you can see that with one full rotation of the sun gear, 20 teeth mesh between the sun and the planet, getting us the 20/60 or 1/3 rotation that the equations predict.  So obviously the math is right and I am just visualizing it wrong.  I can see if I instead twist the ring and watch the center gear it will twist twice to the outer gears one turn, which makes sense in my head for the two to one.  So really what still doesn't make sense is where the 3 to 1 comes from when you hold the ring gear stationary and drive the sun.  Can anyone explain why its not working the way my head seems to think it should work? Or is this there a better sub to ask?

142,Can a linear dynamical system undergo a Hopf bifurcation?,10,h7ruvz,askscience,7,"Another way to state the question: Can Hopf bifurcations exist without limit cycles?

Conceptually I always see a Hopf bifurcation as having two main features: loss of stability of a fixed point and either the generation or loss of a limit cycle (stable/unstable for the sub/supercritical cases respectively).

However, I usually see the Hopf bifurcation formally defined as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis.

This formal definition suggests a linear system such as z'=(a+i)z (where z is complex) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at a=0.

However, linear systems cannot have limit cycles. Is the existence of a limit cycle required for a Hopf bifurcation? And if not, is the process of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis a sufficient condition to guarantee the presence of a limit cycle in a nonlinear system (i.e. can you have nonlinear systems which undergo a Hopf without the presence of a limit cycle, and if so why do we almost always see Hopf bifurcations alongside limit cycles)?

My go to book for this type of thing is Kuznetsov's Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory, which does address this linear case (Remark 4 in section 3.4), but I struggled to get a straight answer as to whether or not the linear case can actually be defined to undergo a Hopf bifurcation.

167,Why do White Blood Cells not form clots in capillary beds?,2,h122uo,askscience,8,"I am a paramedic, and I teach a lot of EMT and Medic refreshers. A big focus is on clots and capillary exchange. We know that for people with abnormally large Red Blood Cells, such as people with Sickle Cell Disease, these abnormal RBCs can clot in the capillary beds and cause significant problems, since normal capillary beds are only big enough to allow one RBC through at a time to maximize perfusion and gas-exchange.

So why to WBCs not cause this same problem? By most estimates, some WBC's are 2-3x the size of red blood cells. Is it something in their chemical composition? Or is it simply related to their inability to clot with each other, even when we have increase WBC numbers (such as during an infection)?

>Given their proximity, the red dwarf star's gravitational pull actually distorts the pulsations of the larger star. This causes the larger star to be distorted into more of a teardrop shape, rather than the usual sphere.

The excerpt from the article that intrigued me. Shouldn't the shape of the Red Dwarf be distorted too, considering the ""larger"" star has more mass than the Red Dwarf?

I initially thought it was a question of ""density"" but later read that if the Sun were replaced by a Black Hole of the same mass, then nothing would change in the Solar System, in terms of orbit and otherwise. So if density is out of the equation, considering the Black Hole example, and the larger star is more massive, shouldn't the distortion also occur in the shape of the Red Dwarf?"

Ask us anything!",4670,h7imbw,askscience,474,"Join us at today at 1 p.m. ET (17 UT) to ask anything about NASA's New Horizons mission! In July 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto and its moons. Recently, the spacecraft - which is more than four billion miles from home and speeding toward interstellar space - took images of the stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 from its unique vantage point in deep space. Scientists combined these images with pictures of the same stars taken near the same time from Earth, creating stereo images that instantly demonstrate the parallax effect astronomers have long used to measure distances to stars. New Horizons is humankind's farthest photographer, imaging an alien sky. Why does New Horizons ""see"" these stars in a different place in the sky than on Earth? How are these images sent back from New Horizons? How long does it take the team on the ground to send commands to the spacecraft? Where is New Horizons headed next?

However, from what I can see reading around, it seems like there is oxygen on Jupiter. Albeit a lot less than hydrogen, but in similar amounts to a lot of the other gasses ( [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063302001447?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063302001447?via%3Dihub) ).

184,Can somebody explain how a COVID test's efficacy depends on the infection's prevalence?,2,h12yvo,askscience,4,"This article [in New York Magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/how-accurate-are-covid-19-tests.html) states that the efficacy of a COVID test (presumably any test detecting a disease) depends on how many people in the population are actually infected with it.

>Tests producing so few false positives may sound promising, but any test’s efficacy is dependent upon its accuracy and the prevalence of the disease in the population — **the lower the prevalence, the greater the chance is that a test result will be wrong. For example, if only 5 percent of the country’s population has been infected over the past three months, a test kit that is 95 percent specific will produce five true positives and five false positives,** meaning any result has only a 50 percent chance of being accurate. In that scenario, even a test with 99 percent specificity would produce false positives 17 percent of the time.

I'm having trouble understanding this concept.  Isn't the accuracy of a test simply a ratio of the estimated number of likely false results to the total number of tests given?  How can a test's accuracy vary with the factual probability of the outcome being tested?

Sorry if I'm being thick.

185,"What is the current, up-to-date recommendations regarding wearing face masks? Do they protect the wearer against catching COVID-19?",9,h14x9b,askscience,17,"There has been a lot of conflicting information in the media and literature regarding face masks protecting against COVID-19. I live in Canada for reference and our Chief Medical Officer at first actually advised against face masks because they were not effective against the virus. Then they said to wear them if it gives you some psychological comfort. Then they started explicitly recommending them in cases where physical distancing is not possible. Now they're making them mandatory on public transit.  

What gives? I've heard that masks apparently protect you from spreading the virus but does not protect you from catching it. But I've also read that it gives you some, but not full protection. But some is better than nothing, right?

There are lots of magpies that I usually notice only visually until yesterday when I heard a song that I couldn’t recognize. 

I looked under the tree they were sitting and there was a cat (common known urban predator for birds) and 3-4 magpies were having the same loud call (that sounded rather alarming) and were following the cat (flying from tree to tree while issuing the same call). 

As soon as the cat disappeared and ran behind bushes (probably out of sight for them) the call stopped. I normally don’t see cats roaming free on the street so I am pretty sure the magpies were trying to warn their fellas about it.

I realise I may have incorrectly assumed that this reaction is instinctual rather than learned.

I suppose it's probably limited to primates in general if it exists at all in other species. I just found it interesting because it's an extremely specific adaptation. Unlike having a reaction to intense heat to withdraw a limb, which any animal can do, it requires having the physiology and dexterity before the adaptation becomes advantageous."

217,"What is the role of coordinate acceleration in general relativity, and how does gravity cause it?",1,h0ndul,askscience,1,"I have been reading material on the Equivalence Principle and General Relativity where an oft mentioned point is that accelerometers don't measure any downward acceleration on objects in free fall *because* gravity is a fictitious force which can be made to disappear in freely falling reference frame. I think all of this makes sense but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration) says something about accelerometers only measuring *proper acceleration*, and gravity is responsible for *coordinate acceleration*. Is proper acceleration only caused by actual physical forces? Then what causes coordinate acceleration, and why/how does gravity cause it?

Also, since GTR tells us that objects in regions of curved spacetime move along curved paths (geodesics), would that count as acceleration? (Since the object's direction is changing even if velocity is constant similar to an object in uniform circular motion). If yes, then is Newtonian Gravity actually trying to explain that ""acceleration"" using a ""force"" because non-Euclidean geometries and curved space, let alone spacetime as concepts didn't exist back then?"

222,How does armor penetration work?,3,h0iega,askscience,5,"I'm a fan of both sci fi and military history (especially tank warfare) but something that has always eluded me is the relationships between projectile mass and velocity on armor penetration.

Example
Lets take the famous .50 BMG sniper rifle round. Basic research gave me the following: (subject to variance depending on round type)

Mass: 45 g 
Muzzle Velocity: 900 m/s
Penetration: roughly 30 mm rolled homogenous armor (RHA) at close range 90 degree impact. Thats over an inch of steel in freedom units so not too shabby!

What would the RHA penetration be in the following scenarios holding all else constant?

A) Double bullet mass (90 g and 900 m/s)
B) Double bullet velocity (45 g and 1800 m/s)

These scenarios both double the momentum but only A doubles the energy, so heres a bonus:

C) Double energy thru velocity (45 g  and 1273 m/s)

Final points:
For A, I'm assuming the way you go about doubling the bullet mass matters. How would a bullet with double the density fare against one thats simply twice as long?

Also I am aware that modern propellants cant get a bullet to 1800 m/s. That being said, magnetic railguns or new plasma/liquid propellents could which makes it interesting to consider.

223,The Big Bang: why don’t atoms fly apart?,1,h0isnu,askscience,4,"Hi all. I read recently that the Big Bang is often misunderstood by laypeople and that it’s not an explosion of matter outwards, but instead an expansion of the universe itself. Accordingly, there is no geographic “middle” as everything in space-time is expanding.

If that’s the case (and please correct me if not), why does this not also occur at the atomic and subatomic level? For example, why does the space within an atom not also expand to the point where the forces holding the atom together are no longer effective, resulting in atoms decaying into their constituent subatomic particles?"
224,What is a (long term) memory?,3,h0lcyn,askscience,2,"I had a discussion about what a memory, or a long term memory, is exactly, and my friend said that a long term memory is a cell, or the neuron (paraphrasing, she's a scientist, so she used a bit more complicated words than I know), where as I said that the memory is the ""electrical firing"" between the neurons, and said that a point to this is that if someone has their brain ""shocked"", and suffer total amnesia, it's not that the neurons are damaged, but that they're ""reset"" in a way, where they ""forget"" the electrical firing for those memories.

Now, I'm open to the fact that I'm wrong, but I'm also not just gonna subjugate to authority and blindly accept what she said, and her explanation for why she was right was very entitled and more of a ""listen to me, kid"", which made me lock up even more.

Only those whose families have lived in the area for thousands of years are immune. After spreading slowly at first, once it reached cities, this Ancient Influenza became the most deadly of all the influenza strains that humans have ever seen.""

I'm supposed to come up with a plan to deal with the virus, so, I was wondering if it's possible to create a vaccine for a new strain of a virus that already has a vaccine? And if so, would it make the process of finding a vaccine any slower or faster? 

If anyone has any insight, i would really appreciate it! Thanks!"

258,Atomspheric lapse rate applied to solids?,0,gzlig6,askscience,14,"The lapse rate which is proportional to g/cp (gravity/ heat capacity) means that the higher you go up in the atmosphere, the cooler it gets. Think white snow capped mountains.

Does this lapse rate formula also apply to solids and explains why it gets hot down the bottom of mines?

Looking at the wikipedia article and derivation there doesn’t seem to be anything particular to gases.

[Wikipedia Lapse Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate?wprov=sfti1) 

Applying the lapse rate formula -9.8/Cp to a deep gold mine gives a similar result.

-9.8/800*4000m= 49oC temperature rise

800 is rough Cp for rock
4000m Mponeng Gold mine depth
66oC is temperature at bottom of mine

[Gold mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mponeng_Gold_Mine?wprov=sfti1)

49+18=67oC

The above is fairly close match so the theory doesn’t sound unreasonable to me."

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

I was thinking about it and I had the thought: how do they know to be produced in a certain direction? (I'll give an example cos it's probably easier to explain what I mean)
So, if you imagine watching a particle come in perfectly horizontal from the right and it's anti-particle come in perfectly horizontal from the left, and they collide in the centre of your vision. They annihilate and end up producing 2 photons, one travelling straight up and the other travelling straight down. Now, what was stopping them (the 2 photons) from travelling towards/away from you or even back the way the particles initially came? Why did they choose* that up/down direction specifically as opposed to any of the other possible directions?

My initial assumption was that it must not be as prevalent considering we have so many examples of different speech patterns to compare and contrast our speech to, which would then influence our own pronunciation, compared to back then when it was very likely that you'd only ever speak with people in your village or neighboring villages.

But then I remembered that I grew up in an area of the United States without the cot/caught merger or the Mary/marry/merry merger, despite those language features being common throughout the vast majority of the United States, and was wondering if I was overvaluing the influence of a common media on the way people speak.

276,Why are galaxy arms stable?,6,gyqvub,askscience,3,"I know that galaxy arms are essentially density waves with stars moving in and out of the wave as they orbit around the galaxy centre. This part makes sense to me. The arms are brighter than the areas between them, and arms being brighter means that there are more stars and is therefore more dense. However, I don't understand how this density wave is stable.

A common analogy to explain galaxy arms is cars slowing down to look at an accident on the side of the road. There is always a clump of cars near the accident, but cars constantly move into and out of the clump. I don't like this analogy because I would think that stars would speed up, not slow down, as they approach the density wave because of the gravitational attraction between that star and the density wave. Similarly, I would think that a star moving out of the density wave would slow down for the same reason. If this were the case, I would expect galaxy arms to quickly fade into a more uniform disc, but we know this to not be the case. What am I missing here?"

Then they held the rod out away from the roundabout whilst on the roundabout. The other end of the rod would be moving around the roundabout at a faster speed than the speed at which the roundabout is spinning. Since the roundabout is spinning at a speed close to the speed of light one would think that the other end of the rod would be moving faster than the speed of light but this is not possible. So what would happen to the rod and the roundabout assuming that there is no atmosphere, the rod is indestructible and the person holding the rod is incredibly strong and and is stuck to the roundabout?"

Not unlike an atom, in which case the nucleus would be here,"" pointing to the top-right corner of the holographic projection of a spherical atom. Although I'm a huge fan of the MCU, I know they're mostly scientifically inaccurate, but still sparked some curiosity within me. I am aware of the unpredictable nature of electrons, which is why I asked if it applied to the nucleus too. Assuming an atom is a so-so approximate sphere, would the nucleus exist exactly at the centre of the sphere or is it in the corner? You can calculate the probability of an electron's position by squaring it's wavefunction and integrating wrt to position. I was curious about the probability density of the nucleus's location, and is it highest at the centre or at another location? Does the unpredictable nature of electrons apply to the nucleus too? If so, can one determine the probability density of the location of a nucleus via the Schrödinger Equation? If so, is there a graph representing this probability density of the location of a nucleus? Hope I've made my question clearer :)

What I gather is happening, is that some people, or even animals, produce particular peptides/proteins that has a tendency to bind to the virus particles, thus stopping the virus from entering cells. But that is very vague, and I have some particular questions around this:

- Does the antibody have to be a peptide/protein? Or could it for example be a complex sugar?

- Are the antibodies always produced as part of a person's or animal's normal immune system? Or could they come from completely random sources - e.g. could, say, haemoglobin just magically happen to inhibit a virus? 

- Are we looking for potential antibodies only in humans, or also animals/plants? What determines where we look?

- Once you've discovered an antibody, how do you get it into patients? Is it as simple as genetically engineering a yeast cell to produce the antibody, and then injecting said antibody into patients' blood? I obviously assume it's much more complicated than that, so would be interested to hear the key challenges."

Here's what I don't get: millions of people in the Western world (and in other areas that don't have malaria) travel to sub-Saharan Africa and other endemic regions every year. Surely there'd be at least a few cases a year of somebody getting infected, going back home (e.g. to a country like Canada) before developing symptoms, other mosquitos (in Canada) biting that person, and then those mosquitos spreading it around the population.

314,How come gold is so electronegative despite it's position on the periodic table?,5,gxb9gi,askscience,5,"I'm sure we were all taught in school that as you move to the right in the periodic table atoms become more electronegative, and the same thing happends as we move up the periodic table. We were also taught why this is. As we move to the right the outer shell of the atom fills up, and the fuller the outer shell the easier it would be to fill up the shell by adding electrons and the more intensly it will attract electrons. The move we move upwards the smaller the atoms become, the closer their outer shells are to the positively charged core and the bigger the pull the core is able to excert.

Gold, among a few other metals, break this trend. Gold is as electronegative as carbon (electronegativity of 2.54 vs 2.55) despite being to the right of tallium (1.62). Why is this?

340,"By blowing the outer sides of a mug, how much more or less effective is this than blowing the top of the mug (directly at the liquid)?",44,gx370u,askscience,12,"Background:  The question comes as  result of my high school science teacher  suggesting in order to cool our  solution in the beaker, we should blow  the outer sides of the beaker  and shouldn't blow from the top directly down into the  solution (like most would when  cooling a hot beverage). I believe he said this  at the time because the fumes  of the solution may have been hazardous  or the solution may splash if we  blow too hard.

Thoughts:  The  sides of mugs usually have a bigger surface area than the  top of  the hot beverage. Via conduction, my thoughts are that the  heat  should disperse into the mug quite rapidly. Additionally, if the  hot beverage is stirred, the surface area touching the sides of the mug is  even more  significant.

Personally, I feel blowing the top of the mug has always been better because I feel the heat escaping as I blow but I'm not sure if this means it's actually better than blowing the sides.

Also, possible variables to consider is stirring and if this would change the outcome, and for the sake of having a clearer direction for this question, lets say the mug is ceramic and holds approximately 250ml (just imagine a typical white mug with a handle)."

342,Can someone please explain some aspects of E=MC^2?,18,gwxjua,askscience,18,"Sorry in advance if these are dumb questions, just trying to understand Einstein’s equation better. 

I understand E represents energy, usually potential energy, but what unit is E measured in? Is it dependent on what units are used in the case of M and C (i.e. using grams or kilograms etc, meters per second or kilometer per second etc) or are all of the variables associated constant units? If it’s constant, what is the correct unit to use for each variable?

For example, take a 5 kg object. Multiply by the speed of light (defined in this case as 299,792,458 m/s), squared, (8.987551787368e16 m/s), which gives us 4.493775893684e17. What unit is this number measured in? 

What makes the speed of light relavent to measuring energy in objects with mass? If light is made up of photons, and photons have a mass of 0, that would make the energy of photons equal to 0 according to this equation. Wouldn’t that mean light contains no energy, and therefore isn’t a form of energy like we know it to be? If it’s not a form of energy, why is light warm? How would solar panels work? How would photosynthesis work? How are lasers powerful enough to cut through metal? These are just examples to explain my thought process, not necessarily other questions that need to be answered.

Ultimately, we were able to literally actually “search” this tree in our mind’s eye to nearly instantly recall whatever we needed on demand.

Effectively, we were taught, for those brief months, how to employ a photographic memory.

But I noticed then — and still, now — that it seems the time to, for lack of a better word, to Spotlight Search our memory, as it were, appears to be a virtually instantaneous act.

Hello ,

I'd like an educated opinion about this topic .

We know that epigenetic changes occur as aging goes on , hence the epigenetic clock .

But what is the root cause of this changes ?

\- Are they objectively detrimental and just a direct consequence of the damage sustained by the chromatin . Alterations that would cause rejuvenation if reversed ?

\- Do they result of an adaptation to ageing : purpously methylating promoters to reduce activity, thus limiting aberrant proteins / cancer ? ( for example testosterone / estrogene reduction could be viewed as a way for the body to limit cancer risk )

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.

387,"If global warming causes the oceans to rise and oceans absorb CO2, is it a considerable negative feedback loop?",3,gvsp6a,askscience,13,I am aware that there are a huge number of factors at play; I'm just wondering if the effect is considerable and worth taking into account in models.

389,"AskScience AMA Series: My name is Matija Ćuk, and I am a research scientist at the SETI Institute specializing in the orbital dynamics of solar system bodies. AMA!",3496,gvrvto,askscience,284,"I earned my undergrad degree in astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, and then I did my PhD in astronomy at Cornell University in 2005. I specialize in the orbital dynamics of solar system bodies, using their present orbit to figure out their past history. I usually use computer simulations, and my job involves quite a bit of programming. Back in graduate school I discovered the BYORP effect, which is driven by solar radiation and which changes the orbits of small binary asteroids very quickly (astronomically speaking). In 2012, Sarah Stewart and I had a paper in Science where we proposed that Earth was spinning very fast when the moon-forming collision happened, which made it possible to make the moon from Earth's material. My part was to show how Earth could lose excess spin afterwards through complex interactions between the Sun and the Moon. In 2016, I revisited this issue and found that early Earth was probably not only spinning super fast but also had a large axial tilt. I have also worked on the dynamics of Saturn's moons, and I proposed in 2016 that Saturn's inner moons and rings are probably only about 100 million years old. Cassini spacecraft results later suggested this is indeed the case, at least for the rings. My latest paper is on the past orbits of Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and how the orbit of Deimos makes sense only if Mars had a large ring about 3 billion years ago.

I will be on at 11am PDT (2 PM ET, 18 UT), AMA!

390,"How is a mosquito's snout able to pick up and transmit diseases such as Malaria, but not HIV/AIDS, a blood trasmittable pathogen?",12,gvm7gj,askscience,5,"From a mere standpoint a mosquito's snout appears to be a miniature extendable jagged surgical needle.
Despite the seemingly [lack of scientific evidence](https://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/infectious/question700.htm) available, there have been incidences such as [this](https://healthland.time.com/2011/04/11/a-scientist-contracts-a-mosquito-borne-virus-and-gives-it-to-wife-as-std/), though the CDC supports that Zika is already a mosquito-borne illness whilst HIV is not. Then my question is: 
What constitutes as a blood-borne and non-mosquito-borne illness?"

392,What makes caffeine so dehydrating?,1,gvoeme,askscience,6,
393,Would a constant acceleration from unlimited energy produce an observation of a non-linear acceleration from a different reference point?,5,gvnuhy,askscience,4,"I am by no means very studied in physics or general relativity.

If my very basic understanding of a factor of general relativity is correct, the faster an object moves compared to another object, the slower time appears to move for that object.

Since velocity is a function of time, and time in affected by relative velocities, would an object under constant acceleration appear to an observer to non accelerate in a linear fashion?

As the object moves faster and faster, would the time dilation produce an effect where the object, moving in its own relative field, experiences the same acceleration, but from out outside perspective, due to a comparitively slower time dilation, see the object as accelerating faster and faster, in a third derivative of position sense.


To perhaps clarify.

If Velocity is related to time, and time is related to velocity, would not an accelerating object eventually appear to an outside observer as having infinite acceleration and velocity due to having no time? A division by zero scenario?"
394,How does AC Hum work?,7,gvn65i,askscience,1,"When I touch an aux cable and hear a 60hz sine wave, I have been told that this is because my body acts like an antenna for the electrical signals in my house and completes a circuit with the speaker when I touch the cable. 
But how exactly does this work?"
395,How do stem cells get to the axillary meristem?,3,gvalvw,askscience,2,"I am wondering, as the shoot apical meristem begins to grow do some stem cells migrate over to the axillary meristem that originally existed in the SAM. Alternatively since some plant cells are totipotent, do normal cells convert back to stem cells in order to generate the axillary meristem?"
396,Why does the Jet stream converge and diverge?,6,gvig7j,askscience,1,"From what i've understood about meteorology; low and high pressure happens when e.g. the jet stream converges or diverges. I understand the basics of how this causes low and high pressure, and how the jet streams works, but not why it converge and diverge.

What causes the convergence and divergence in the first place? Has it something to do with the temperature gradient? if so, what causes the temperature to vary that much, so close together?"
397,How is it possible that viruses lead to the origin of life if viruses need a living host to survive?,7,gvlw0q,askscience,4,"According to the virus-first hypothesis, DNA-based viruses predate cellular life and contributed to its formation.

398,Can Rat Lungworm nematodes survive in dead snail shells?,1,gv8pc0,askscience,1,"I recently read about rat lungworm disease and that people usually get the disease from eating infected snails or consuming unwashed vegetables that contain snail secretions. I'm wondering if dead snail shells pose a risk as well. 

Can the nematode that carries the rat lungworm disease survive in the muck of a dead snail shell? 

Is there a realistic risk of getting rat lungworm disease from handling and playing with dead snail shells?

Is this disease everywhere? I see a lot of discussion about it in Hawaii and Asia. Is it in the continental US (I am in Texas)?

399,Are there any birds which produce a blue pigment?,5,gv6x0w,askscience,6,"I've seen statements to the effect of ""no bird species can make blue from pigments"" ([example](https://insider.si.edu/2016/04/blue-bird-not-blue/)), but I've also seen many sources saying that blue is only ""typically"" the result of structural color ([example 1](https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2007/oct/16/birds-physics), [example 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jay)).

But I can't find any specific mentions of a particular bird species which manufacture a blue pigment, so I'm left wondering if any actually exist or if all of the sources saying it's ""typically"" the result of structural color are just hedging in case there's one they didn't know about.

Do we know of even a single bird species which has non-structural blue color?"

401,What is the relationship between insulin and hGH?,5,gv3p74,askscience,0,"Hello everyone!
I am a last year med student I was reading my physiology textbook(Guyton’s) and something confused me.
In the book in some chapter it says different thing about insulin secretion and insulin resistance mechanism of hGH also Insulin like Growth Hormone.
I can understand some of them true but I think there is a problem I couldn’t get it.
From clinic I know hGH cause insulin resistance.
In book it says different things.
hGH secreted in lack of insulin
In other chapter it says hGH necessary for insulin action and also insulin and hGH synergetic.
I googled and in many places it says different things
Like in wiki says insulin induce growth hormone secretion.
Also at beginning in book glucagon inhibit insulin secretion later it promotes it.
What am I missing?

407,Why do rivers take the names they have?,1,gv0st1,askscience,3,"I have trouble explaining this, but I will use the example of the Mississippi River. As the Mississippi goes south it meets many rivers like the Ohio which where they meet the Ohio river looks bigger. I would think that the river that looks bigger would be the one that continues. Is it the rivers speed or what determines what river will continue its name when two rivers meet?"
408,"How do we know the age, size, density, make up, temperature, and overall appearance of exoplanets?",1,gv0078,askscience,6,"Like I guess I get how we know all of that stuff the planets in our own solar system but for planets like 30 light years away, how do we know all of these characteristics of extremely far away planets?

414,Honey bees shiver to produce heat during the winter. Doesn't this make them warm blooded?,5,gvk0vs,askscience,2,"I've always heard that insects are cold blooded. And that cold blooded animals rely on external sources of heat for thermal regulation. But when it gets cold honey bees will cluster and shiver to maintain a high core temperature. 

https://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/2/353

Doesn't that mean that at least some insects are warm blooded?"
415,How does the ancient eruption of Krakatoa compare to our most recent volcanic eruptions and atomic bombs?,13,gveiup,askscience,9,"I actually asked this in r/homeworkhelp not too long ago, but I am genuinely still curious about this.  Do we even have estimates of how devastating Krakatoa's damage is?  What are they, and how do they compare to the damage of some of the most recent volcanic eruptions and atom-bomb blasts?"
416,Black Lives Matter,50820,gvc7k9,askscience,3031,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

424,Why do some very expensive CPUs use lots of slow cores vs. fewer very fast cores?,12,gv2pxp,askscience,17,"Basically my question as an amateur computer builder and IT curious person with not a ton of in depth knowledge of computer engineering is this: 

Server grade processors, which have MSRPs that at the highest price point are $20,000+US, seem to utilize tons of cores running in the mid 2.5 GHz range per core. 

High end enthusiast processors run significantly less in the $500 - $1000 range and have core speeds that are now pushing past the 5 GHz range per core. 

What are the limitations or engineering reasons why you don't see at this moment, Intel or AMD releasing CPUs with massive core counts and also massive clock speeds? Wouldn't it theoretically be an advantage to have a ton of super fast cores? Are the reasons economic or due to engineering or technological limitation?   


A more minor follow up would be is this something that the future of CPU design has in store or is it less practical as high core counts and programs meant to utilize multi-core systems become more common and standard?"

One problem with this approach is that a person who has recovered from COVID might still have the viral genetic material in their system but no “live” virus. In that case, the RT-PCR test could be a false indicator of potential infectiousness.

Are there tests under development - or available for other viruses - that look for something that is a better indicator of infectiousness?

The main example I'm questioning is a regular propane grill, I don't understand how the fire doesn't run back up the fuel line and blow up the tank. It seems like the gas is coming out slow enough that this would be possible.

I have seen videos of people spraying hair spray and lighting it on fire, then the whole can explodes. How does this happen, but my propane tank doesn't explode on my grill?

In regards to the SpaceX rockets, my uneducated assumption is that the fuel is coming out of the pumps into the combustion chamber at such high speeds that the only way the flames can go is out.

I understand that they want to have a ground state but what's the benefit of that? I've heard one view on Quora suggesting that it's to do with the universe favouring less entropy in a system.

484,"Why do veins look blue, even when it is not under cutaneous tissue?",11,gtmkig,askscience,1,"I've been reading around, trying to find a satisfying answer, but it all seems to come down to ""well deoxygenated blood doesn't really look blue, it's just that the skin scatters the light in such a way that it looks blue.

However, I've got a few problems with that answer:

* In **osteogenesis imperfecta**, patients are described as having 'blue sclera' because of a thinning of the sclera, making the underlying choroidal blood vessels visible. There is *no skin* over these blood vessels, but a thin sclera.
* In **open surgeries** (like in an open heart surgery), you can see the veins as looking sort of dark-purplish.

In these contexts, are the overlying tissues (the sclera and, I guess, the adventitia of the veins) responsible for the blue discoloration by having the same scattering effects as the skin? How does this scattering effect come about, and how come pretty much all human tissues have those same properties?

Also, from what I searched online, people mainly seemed to focus on the distinction between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. But what about carbaminohemoglobin? I've seen some sources say carbaminohemoglobin has a 'distinctive blue color'. First off, is that true? If I took a blood sample, put it in a closed container, and then somehow got rid of all the O2 and replaced it with carbon dioxide, would the sample start becoming purplish-blue? If so, does that also play a role in the blue color of veins, or of the skin and mucosae of a cyanotic patient?

I know the question of 'why are veins blue' has probably been asked a lot, but I really haven't found any satisfying answers, especially in the case of osteogenesis imperfecta (which is what brought me to start researching this subject).

530,ELI8 for Rain vs Bubbles please?,13,gs6tff,askscience,13,"My 8yo recently discovered that bubbles do not pop in the rain, even rain brought in by a tropical storm (honestly, I was surprised too, I thought the torrential downpour would pop them). I tried to look up the science behind it and couldn't find an explanation that I understood well enough to explain it on the 8yo's level.

 Can any one help us out? We're still curious and ridiculously gleeful that you can blow bubbles in a tropical storm and they will just happily beebop around in the wind and rain. TIA!"
531,What would happen to plants and animals if the magnetosphere was weakened?,2,grxzum,askscience,5,"I know that exposure to solar radiation, in space for example, can cause blindness or genetic mutations.  I'm wondering how an increase in solar radiation would effect flora, fauna, and the climate."

534,Do we have any idea what came before our solar system?,17,gs2p2k,askscience,3,"My understanding is that around 4.5 billion years ago our star formed out of a cloud of gas and dust, and that our planet formed out of what was left. But what was that gas and dust? Where did it come from? I am assuming that it did not come directly from the Big Bang, because there was too much complex stuff in there. So did we form from the remenents of a supernova or a single dead old star? Did we form out of many old stars or did many new stars form out of a single old star? If the old stars had run out of fuel and finally died, where did the new fuel come from to ignite new stars?"
535,"Why do planets like Neptune and Uranus have rocky cores the size of Earth and yet insanely huge atmospheres, and yet the Earth has such a thin atmosphere?",13,grvs3s,askscience,11,"Side question - Is the Earth the ""rocky core"" of our planet?"
536,"Etymologists: How exactly do etymologists determine, with certainty, that in some form a word transferred from one unrelated language to another, at some point in the past?",19,grvs2g,askscience,5,"I know that documents/primary sources are an essential resource in regards to etymology - but my studies only required a few linguistics courses. So my knowledge on etymology itself is lacking.


How exactly do etymologists determine when a word transferred from one language, to another language that does not share a common ancestry? For example, words in modern Japanese that came from the English language, or another indo-european language. I am sure there are countless examples with many languages - but most importantly, what sort of things are taken as solid proof of the transfer occurring?


Is there much debate among etymologists about how those words got their origins? Also, are there examples of words that came to be, similar to the concept of convergent evolution?

Edit: added a word for clarity."

541,Why are rocket launch windows so narrow/sparse?,53,grrv22,askscience,33,"The falcon 9 launch today was scrubbed due to weather, the commentators seemed to think the weather would have cleared 10 mins after T-0, I get that they need to arrive on time to intercept ISS at the right moment, but why not just wait 90 mins for ISS to come back around?"
542,What do we know about Covid-19 and mutation rate?,11,grqbdu,askscience,7,"I haven't seen this asked, but if it was I apologize for missing it. I have several related questions I'm hoping y'all can help with. To my knowledge, viruses can mutate at will. Are there concerns about Covid-19 mutating? Do we know the rate at which that virus is likely to mutate? If the virus mutates, is it possible for it to become more severe/lethal? How would scientists know if it did mutate?"
543,Can you build a laser powerful enough to mess with satellites in orbit?,13,grjshi,askscience,8,"A conversation about Starlink got me started down a rabbit hole of imaging satellites currently in orbit and potential ""vandalism"" from the ground.

545,Is all crude oil pumped from any given well the same?,6,gr4xl6,askscience,10,"What I mean by this is, do they have the same proportion of hydrocarbons for example? I understand that cracking separates the hydrocarbons from crude oil by different molecular weights through fractional distillation, so I was wondering if the average barrel of oil from one well might have a different proportion of some hydrocarbon than from another well. 

If so, does this mean that oil from some wells, given the difference in these proportions, might be more or less valuable than the oil from another well?

Thanks."
546,Do volcanic eruptions affect Earth's magnetic field?,7,gr55pg,askscience,4,I'm doing a little research about volcanoes and I want to know the connection between volcanoes and magnetics. I learned that the Earth's magnetic field is basically generated by the flowing iron-rich magma and the rotation of the Earth (which creates a dynamo effect). If my understanding of the magnetic field is off pls correct me. Does this mean volcanic eruptions somehow affect the magnetic field because of the magnetic lava? Do volcanoes have anything to do with the polarity switches throughout Earth's history? What's the connection between volcanoes and the magnetic field?
547,Have ACE inhibitors been tested as a treatment for COVID-19?,6,grjgbv,askscience,7,"I am most likely massively over simplifying this, but if the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters host cells using angiotensin-converting enzyme, why can’t  the virus be stopped/slowed down from entering cells using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors?"

549,AskScience AMA Series: Hello Reddit! We're a group of climate researchers and engineers working on new technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Ask us anything!,4326,grhn03,askscience,464,"We're Nan Ransohoff and Ryan Orbuch from the Climate team at **Stripe**. Our work to mitigate the threat of climate change focuses on an underexplored part of the problem-removing carbon from the atmosphere directly, which is essential if the world is to meet its warming targets. Last week, after a rigorous search and review from independent scientific experts, we [announced](https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases) Stripe's first purchases from four negative emissions projects with great potential. We hope this will help create a large and competitive market for carbon removal. 

**CarbonCure**: I'm Rob Niven, Founder and CEO of [CarbonCure Technologies](https://www.carboncure.com/). Our technology chemically repurposes waste CO_2 during the concrete manufacturing process by mineralizing it into calcium carbonate (CaCO_3)-reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering material costs, and improving concrete quality. The technology is already being used at 200+ concrete plants from Miami to Singapore to build hundreds of construction projects from highrises to airports.

**Charm Industrial**: We're Kelly Hering and Shaun Meehan, founding engineers at [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/). We have created a novel process for converting waste biomass into bio-oil, which we then inject deep underground as negative emissions-creating a permanent geologic store for carbon. 

**Climeworks**: I'm Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of [Climeworks](https://www.climeworks.com/). We use renewable geothermal energy and waste heat to capture CO_2 directly from the air, concentrate it, and permanently sequester it underground in rock formations. 

**Project Vesta**: We're Eric Matzner and Tom Green from [Project Vesta](https://projectvesta.org/). Project Vesta captures CO_2 by using an abundant, naturally occurring mineral called olivine. Ocean waves grind down the olivine, which captures atmospheric CO_2 from within the ocean and stabilizes it as limestone on the seafloor.

550,Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses?,10,gresli,askscience,2,
551,What is the process in which someone regains their memory if they have say retrograde amnesia?,8,gqt97y,askscience,1,"I’m kind of curious now because after watching The Vow for a second time (not a great movie if I’m being honest) I wonder what it would have been like if the girl had gotten her memory back. Say someone were to start regaining memories, would it all flood back at once some time after the accident or would it be small things or in chronological order? Would you remember the people or events you forgot when you wake up one morning? And how long would it take to fully regain your memory if you could?"
552,What makes the seeds in a chilli spicier than the flesh?,10,gqsz7u,askscience,5,
553,Does the mind decay as we sleep?,3,gqs6n6,askscience,4,"I don't know much about neuroscience or psychology but I remember reading that if we don't use particular brain functions for a long time it will start to decay. Like if someone doesn't play piano for 3 years they won't play as well as if they had been continuing to practice. 

So I had a thought, if someone slept for a long time without previous brain trauma would they lose brain function?

For example if someone was in a coma or cryogenically frozen(I know this is fictional) for several years would they still be the same functioning person as they were before?"
554,"What is the difference between osteoporosis, osteopenia & osteopetrosis?",2,gqryi7,askscience,4,
555,Do accessory spleens pose any intrinsic problems?,4,gqqj75,askscience,1,"I want to be clear: this is not a condition I have, I'm not asking for medical advice.  I simply found out about it as I was traversing a rather deep Wikipedia rabbit-hole, and now I'm curious about something.

What I""m finding in lay-understandable sources seems to suggest that accessory spleens are a problem primarily because they can complicate diagnosis or treatment of other issues.  For example, an accessory spleen can appear to be something else, or perhaps obscure something else, on a CT scan.  Or maybe if someone has a malady that requires a splenectomy, it's possible to only remove the main spleen and not realize that more needs to be done, meaning that the malady still exists.

So the impression I'm getting is that their mere presence, in and of themselves, does not cause any medical problems; they merely create practical difficulties in diagnosing and treating certain other problems that may arise.  Is this correct?"

557,"Can ants smell their food, and if so, from how far away?",5,gra1zp,askscience,8,"Do they find food through a sense of smell or some other sense, or is it just random luck? Just curious if the ants are actively ""hunting"" their food supply."
558,"Does the information passed through separated twisted pair photons, such as in quantum radar, travel faster than the speed of light?",2,gr2w1b,askscience,7,"I've been loosely following the subject, it is a game changer.  It was my understanding that when twisted photons are separated and one undergoes a state change, then the other registers the same state change regardless of the distance between the two.  Is this instantaneous?  If it is instantaneous, would not the information of the state change have, in effect, traveled faster than the speed of light?  Here is a small reference article:

559,"If a mother bird couldn't find enough food, would she let all her babies starve, or favor one/some and only feed them?",420,gr72dd,askscience,45,"Sort of a morbid question, I know. A friend had a nest of robins in their yard, and just found all the babies dead under the nest, and hypothesized that a lack of food could be the cause of death. I didn't think that was likely, but didn't want to bring it up or force the issue when my friend is quite sad about the dead baby birds. I figure that if the mama bird knew that she wasn't finding enough food, she would choose one of her babies to favor and feed with what she could find, to give the best chance of her genes surviving in the next generation. Is this true? Or would she feed them equally and let them all die? If it informs the answer, the mother is still alive. Thanks in advance!"
560,Do our bodies make antibodies with multiple paratope configurations for the same pathogen?,16,gr3z4m,askscience,4,"The SARS-COV-2 virus has many different unique epitopes. When a person gets infected, does their body actually make antibodies with multiple different paratopes? 

In other words, does a body's antibody response actually consist of various antibodies with various differing paratopes binding to various different unique epitopes on a single pathogen? 

A single SARS-CoV-2 virus could be surrounded by antibodies, but they're actually binding at different epitope areas based on their various different paratope configurations, with some having a higher binding affinity than others?"
561,"If the coronavirus is respiratory and you can't get it from eating infected food, why can you get it through your eyes?",41,gr40hr,askscience,24,"I have read articles stating that there is no evidence of anyone getting COVID-19 via food. The reasoning I have seen medical experts give is that COVID-19 and its virus are respiratory, so you get it from breathing it in, and if you eat it, your digestive system is separate so you won't get infected. But why then would getting the virus on your hands and then touching your eyes infect you? With your nose and mouth, my assumption was that you could end up breathing it in somehow. But I don't understand why it getting in your eyes would give it to you. I haven't seen this specifically explained anywhere. Thank you!"
562,Could previous exposure to other human coronaviruses prevent COVID-19 infection?,16,gqzrlj,askscience,2,"I was reading this article [T cells found in COVID-19 patients ‘bode well’ for long-term immunity](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/t-cells-found-covid-19-patients-bode-well-long-term-immunity) which says

>The teams also asked whether people who haven’t been infected with SARS-CoV-2 also produce cells that combat it. Thiel and colleagues analyzed blood from 68 uninfected people and found that 34% hosted helper T cells that recognized SARS-CoV-2. The La Jolla team detected this crossreactivity in about half of stored blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, well before the current pandemic began. The researchers think these cells were likely triggered by past infection with one of the four human coronaviruses that cause colds; proteins in these viruses resemble those of SARS-CoV-2.

Regarding previous exposure to human coronaviruses, [NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63) looks awfully similar to COVID-19 because they both attack via the ACE2 receptor. What kind of research would be needed to establish a link between NL63 exposure and COVID-19 immunity? If there is a link between NL63 (or another human coronaviruses) exposure and COVID-19 immunity, would intentionally exposing people to NL63 act like a natural vaccine to COVID-19?"
563,How fast does the humoral immune response occur (after becoming immune)?,1,gqy4yt,askscience,8,"Hi! 

I was wondering about the speed of the humoral immune response... Once immunity towards a certain antigen is achieved following a first time infection, how fast is the body's response to reinfection? Does the body develop and maintain the memory cells for an extended period of time, with these continuously pumping out antibodies with the specific surface receptors just in case reinfection occurs, or is there an ""oh shit"" moment wherein the body has to look through its ""immunity catalogue"" to then produce the required antibodies? And finally, whichever the process is, when the known antigen re-enters the body, how fast does it take for the body to trigger and execute the immune response so as to eradicate antigen from the body?

Thanks!"
564,Why does somatotropin (HGH) released from the pituitary gland cause bodily growth but not artificial HGH?,8,gqyww4,askscience,2,"In other words, why does an overactive pituitary gland, such as in gigantism/acromegaly, cause physical growth, but not when artificially introduced? I ask because I was reading about Robert Wadlow, and it's said he probably had a tumor on his pituitary that caused the excessive growth. Obviously his height wasn't the result of his genes, as his parents were normal height. So, if a malfunctioning pituitary can cause excessive growth, why doesn't artificial HGH? If a child had idiopathic short stature (ISS) due to genetics, why would HGH therapy not cause extra growth in the same way a tumor would?

Sorry if my question is worded strangely. Thanks!"
565,Is there research that shows that the absence of certain physical stressors that were present in distant past and experienced by our ancestors can worsen brain function and create mental health issues like depression?,3,gquta3,askscience,9,
566,Why is there so little neon in Earth's atmosphere?,34,gqxjaw,askscience,8,"Neon is the 5th most common element in the universe, more so than argon. The molar mass is also 20, higher than water’s 18, so it probably doesn’t escape into space like helium does. Despite being so common, argon outnumbers neon 500:1 in the atmosphere. Why? Is it because Earth simply didn’t start with any and that the argon came from radioactive decay? Is that why there is so much Ar-40 in the atmosphere because we never had Ar-36 to begin with?"
567,Why doesn't the CDC provided Oligonucleotide Sequences provided for Covid-19 testing match any sub-sequences provided in the updated published Covid-19 genome (version 2)?,7,gqxvrm,askscience,13,"I have been investigating the Covid-19 testing process and more specifically how the tests were created.

From my understanding, the CDC has published Oligonucleotide Sequences ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)) that should be used by US RT-PCR test creators to detect the presence of Covid-19. From my understanding, these published sequences are the signatures for detection of the virus.

In trying to understand how these sequences were created, I took the original published sequenced genome ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2)) published in the ""Chinese Medical Journal"" and tried to find the provided CDC sequence as it is my assumption that the CDC published sequences should match the original covid-19 sequenced genome. I was able to successfully find the first provided forward primer ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT""  matching the end of line number 28261.

However, the scientists have updated the genome with a new version on Jan 17, 2020 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)) and I am unable to find the sequence ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT"" in this Covid-19 genome. I have also checked the reverse (CTG GGG TTT ...) without luck.

I would assume the entire point of picking good Oligonucleotide Sequences is they should stay static over all possible Covid-19 changes. The CDC clearly says it may change these sequences but they haven't. How is this possible to have a different published Covid-19 genome that the CDC's test doesn't detect? Isn't the fact the genome was updated problematic? Could the CDC test ""verified"" test not actually be effective as a result? Did the CDC do it's own large scale sequencing effort since the first sequence was collected from only 5 individuals."
568,What is the scientific term for the amount of current/electricity a material can endure before being destroyed/melting?,2,gqdl33,askscience,12,"I don't really know how to explain it but I'll do my best. Take a lightbulb, when it blows, what's the term for that limitation?"
569,"Do galaxies regularly ""disappear"" from the edge of the observable Universe due to the ever expanding nature of space?",6,gqdbhp,askscience,24,"Here are my assumptions:

1. The space in the Universe is expanding rapidly, attaining light speeds or even more at far away distances. This why we can only see a part of the Universe because light from beyond that point travels slower than the expanding space between it and us.

2. The space within the observable Universe(which let's assume is a sphere) is also expanding and therefore at a certain point the galaxy at the edge must ""spill"" out of the surface of the observable sphere.

Have we ever observed this phenomena?"

571,What causes the effect of trenchfoot?,2,gqq65y,askscience,3,"Ive been reading about ww1 and how one condition the soliders got was trench foot, where their foots would essentially melt or disintegrate. I was wondering what exactly caused the muscles to become so weak it would crumble? I read that it had to do with how being in water for long periods of time causes loss of circulation but my question is what about this interaction with water causes loss of circulation?"
572,Does the Earth's rotation create centripetal force against everything on it's surface? If so does that mean we aren't experiencing gravity as strong as it should be?,8,gqben9,askscience,3,

My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. 

I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, *The Elegant Universe*, *The Fabric of the Cosmos*, *The Hidden Reality*, and just recently, *Until the End of Time*. *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)* and *[The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)* were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, *Icarus at the End of Time*, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage *[Light Falls](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)*, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.

These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.

I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.

There is no ""antibody."" There is no ""the antibody"" for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 for instance can have multiple unique areas on their protein structures in which multiple different antibodies can be generated, so one recovered patient can have slightly different antibodies compared to another recovered patient, but both of their antibodies will still bind to different unique areas of SARS-CoV-2.

There are even companies that have whittled down numerous different antibody candidates to a few that have especially high neutralizing abilities against SARS-COV-2, the point being that multiple different antibodies can bind to one pathogen.

So when people talk about an ""antibody test,"" what are they talking about, exactly? 

Does the test actually detect the presence of *multiple* different antibodies, all of which have demonstrated binding effects with the virus? 

Or do the tests only detect one specific configuration of antibody, and can miss other antibody configurations, resulting in a false negative (the patient actually had been infected and did produce antibodies, just not the ones that the test is specific for)."

I generally respond that this will involve many times the number of deaths that have occurred already.  My rationale is quite simple: Covid-19 has a current 1.4% mortality rate (due mostly to old people and people with poor immune function), and 'herd immunity' involves at least 60% population immunity (likely higher to be more effective). That means that if we just let the disease continue to spread as it has, the final USA death count will be 330million x 60% x 1.4% = 2.8 million.  Even if we somehow could control who gets the virus to restrict it to the healthiest people, this would mean something like a 0.4% total mortality (lowest group-mortality by age seems to be around 0.2-0.3%, and let's assume it spreads a bit outside of that).  In this case, 330million x 60% x 0.4% = 800,000 dead.  Are these assumptions valid, or am I missing something major in my estimation?"

Here is where my understanding is at:
1. I understand that atoms are brought to near 0K, meaning they have near zero kinetic energy.
2. I understand that these atoms need to have an upper energy limit so that they can be in a state of maximum potential energy during this process.
3. Temperature is not just the kinetic energy of particles, but includes interaction and potential energy as well.

Where my understanding breaks down is how inverting the kinetic and potential energies creates a negative Kelvin temperature. Why does taking an atom to it's upper energy limit create a negative temperature?

I read this article on it: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130104143516.htm

667,What exactly triggers the act of fledging of songbirds?,0,go3ol9,askscience,0,"Since currently (in my country) I see (and hear) many bird youngsters (Blue and Great Tit) around, I wondered when do baby birds decide to leave their nest?

Since all youngsters in the bird house leave at the same time, I wondered if there is some kind of triggering action (e.g. a parent's distinctive call or when the strongest sibling hops out)?"

669,Humans/human ancestors have been eating cooked food for ~2 million years. Do we have any adaptations for eating hot food that other animals don't?,9,go58nt,askscience,3,"For example, everyone has the experience of biting into food that's too hot and burning the roof of their mouth. If something like a chimpanzee were to do that would their mouth burns be more serious or heal slower than ours?

670,Is meat as we know it today biologically the same as meat from the cretaceous period or has it evolved over time?,6,go73ab,askscience,2,"I know next to nothing about biology so I apologize if this is a bad question.

Would the digestive tracts of an animal be able to digest meat from a different period of time or would there be any differences as a result of evolution that would somehow make it non digestible or non nutritious? 

For example, I know carnivores cant synthesize certain vitamins and therefore have to eat meat. Have these same vitamins existed consistently in meat since the dawn of time?

I'm legitimately curious and want to learn. Mods please don't remove for being too ""theoretical"", I'm trying my best to word it in a way that isn't."

672,Why is Austenitic Steel (FCC) Non-Ferromagnetic?,8,gohl34,askscience,6,"I know carbon steel has a Curie point near the austenitic transformation temperature, so I always thought that high temperature steel lost its ferromagnetism because the thermal energy kept re-orienting Weiss domains so they can't properly align. The blacksmith trick of using a magnet to tell if steel is austenitic is just a guess, because carbon steel actually reaches its Curie temperature a bit before the austentic transformation temperature. 

I didn't realize until recently that room temperature austenitic steel (stainless steel) is also not ferromagnetic. My first thought was that this was somehow due to crystal structure (some symmetry operation in FCC that forbids ferromagnetism?) but that doesn't work because there are other examples of FCC metals that exhibit ferromagnetism, like Ni or Co alloys.

My next thought was that Weiss domains in FCC might get thermally misaligned more easily, so perhaps the Curie temperature would be decreased in FCC metals, and Ni could stay ferromagnetic because it had a Curie temperature above 300K. However, Ni has a smaller magnetic moment per atom and a lower melting temperature (than iron or stainless steel), so assuming Curie temperatures occur at roughly the same homologous temperature, Ni should have a lower Curie temperature (it does have a lower Curie temperature than BCC iron).

That leaves me with no explanation for why steel loses its ferromagnetism upon becoming FCC. Does anyone have any ideas?"
673,The difference between Atlantic ocean water and Mediterranean sea water is gradual? Or is it immediately visible at the left and right of the strait of Gibraltar?,4,goiwkk,askscience,5,
674,How come gemstones don't cold weld?,6,goa9b5,askscience,4,"I understand that cold welding largely doesn't happen by accident (unless you're in space) because you have to remove any oxide layers and make very precise and extended contact. As far as I know, gemstones don't have oxide layers and since they're cut flat with high precision, what's to stop them from cold welding? My knowledge on the subject is a little simplistic, only going as far as that [Feynman explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_welding)."
675,What happens to cell organelles during meiosis? Are they quadri-replicated in G1 like in mitosis?,4,gocu7k,askscience,1,
676,Why do metal ions like calcium get released from calcium oxalate when boiled?,3,goe0ne,askscience,2,"I'm writing an investigation on how boiling vegetables affect the calcium loss. I came across a few articles that says calcium exists as calcium oxalate, and when it's boiled the bonds between calcium oxalate breaks and the calcium ions are leached into the water. I'm struggling to find any information on the mechanism behind this as in how this actually works. Can someone direct me to any sources or explanations on this process?"

678,What mammal is least related to all other mammals?,13,goeq6d,askscience,11,That might have been a bad way of phrasing the question but basically you know how all animals have a closest living relative and that broader group will be closely related to a similar broader group so on and so forth but what mammal or even group of mammals is the most distant from all other living groups
679,Do bears have polarised eyes like some birds?,3,goew06,askscience,1,So I've seen the video of the bear catching salmon over on r/naturalisfuckinglit and wondered if bears have polarised eyes like herron do? In that video the water is very fast moving and has a lot of glare.

685,Is the likelihood of going bankrupt higher for people who have filed for it before?,0,goh642,askscience,2,"If you file for bankruptcy once your chances of getting decent credit are screwed for years, even decades, because creditors treat you like a much much higher risk.

I was wondering if there are any actual scientific studies proving that people who went bankrupt once are significantly  more likely to go bankrupt again.

Looked it up an couldn't find anything. I guess the methodology would be problematic because you need a sample of people who went bankrupt but had it erased from their history, to compare the outcomes reliabely. And keeping track of them for a long time. But anyways... Anyone aware of such data existing?"

689,"Can awake, spontaneously breathing patients on ECMO hold their breath indefinitely?",18,godlzs,askscience,8,"So my 34 year old sister recently suffered a dissected aorta. After a successful surgery and failed mechanical ventilation, it appears she has probably slipped into ARDS and is now requiring ECMO. I'm a CCU nurse but I've never done open heart, mostly Neuro and trauma. I've never even seen ECMO, as only a few hospitals in my state have that capability. But I'm familiar enough to know a bit about how it works, but I can't stop thinking about this question.  Since a machine is removing the blood and filtering CO2 and adding oxygen, then pumping it back in, could an awake, spontaneously breathing patient simply hold their breath indefinitely? I meant to ask the doctor today over the phone, but it slipped my mind."

693,Is it more difficult for a virus to mutate if the host is healthy?,7,goauhq,askscience,7,"Friends and I got into an argument about this. My take is that the virus will simply mutate without regard to the immune system of the host. 

Their argument is that if the virus infects healthy people without infecting those who are immunocompromised or overall unhealthy, the virus becomes weaker and weaker.

For what I see, when you decompose a signal in an infinite sum of sines and cosines (even dilated or shrinked) you are giving each frequency a ""weight"" or a ""share"" on the total signal. What does it mean to filter a signal? Will it remove the ""low"" sinuisoids and cosinusoids?"

I know there are 5 types of antibodies: IgG, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgE.

Are there different *subtypes* of these? For example, would your body produce one type of IgG to fight the common cold and a different type of IgG to fight COVID 19? (assuming IgG fights both for this example)

If not, and people are taking antibody tests to see if they already had COVID, how do we know elevated IgG levels (for example) doesn't mean someone has had shingles (or other illness) and that's the reason for elevated IgG levels?

705,Aerodynamics: why should max lift-to-drag airspeed be the same as min-drag airspeed?,10,gnzjxx,askscience,6,"I need help from someone who knows aerodynamics well, in connection with aerodynamics study material that all student pilots are asked to learn, specifically how the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio varies as a function of airspeed.

The basic idea is to give the pilot an intuition of the fact that lift grows quadratically with airspeed, and so (somewhat) does drag, but there's a component of drag (induced) that grows a lot if you fly slow. For this reason, total drag exhibits a U-shaped plot, and the airspeed corresponding to the butt of the U is a sweet spot that gives you best range. That's the airspeed you should fly at for best economy, and the airspeed to establish in case of engine loss, to achieve best glide distance. If you fly faster, you glide less, and if you also fly slower, you also glide less.

More specifically, Most ground schools, including official FAA sanctioned material, present the same or very similar airspeed-drag charts, all having airspeed in knots on the x axis, and arbitrary drag units on y. They all plot parasite, induced, form (sometimes) and total drag curves. (Total drag D is the sum of parasite, induced and form drag.) Here is an example: [https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course\_content\_popup.aspx?cID=104&sID=448](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course_content_popup.aspx?cID=104&sID=448)

They consistently make the claim that **the airspeed maximizing L/D is also the one that minimizes total drag**.

Note: they don't say that the two airspeeds (the one maximizing L/D and the one minimizing D) are **close enough** that we can confound them. No, they say they are the same.

I'm a weekend pilot with a background in engineering and a day job in a quantitative field, and this claim bothers me. I played around for five minutes with a graphic calculator and plugged in simple functions that look close enough to those in the abstract plots:

* DI = Induced drag = 1/(500v)
* DF = Form Drag = 5 + 1/100 (v-45)\^2
* DP = Parasite Drag = 1/200 v\^2
* L = Lift = 1/5 v\^2   \*\*\*
* D = Total Drag = DI+DF+DP

Of course, empirical experiments confirm my intuition that there's no chance in hell that argmax(L(v)/D(v)) matches argmin(D(v)).

Am I right? Am I wrong?

Of course the FAA's goal is not to teach physics, it's rather to give pilot simplified, actionable intuition that is mostly physically correct and that inspires the right in-flight decision.

But I'd like to hear from an expert how things really are.

**UPDATE:**

**SOLVED! ------------** Thanks to the kind redditors who answered.

I was incorrectly assuming that in these charts, lift was made to vary as a function of airspeed.

This is a result of my brain being primed to equation L = 1/2 CL ρ S v^(2), the lift equation, that one typically studies in the same chapter.

If you assume constant CL and constant air density ρ, of course lift grows quadratically with airspeed.

However, these charts assume steady, unaccelerated, level flight, in which lift is constant, and made to exactly balance weight. As airspeed grows, smaller and smaller AoA are needed to balance W, and correspondingly smaller and smaller CL values.

Then, L becomes a constant, and   argmax(L(v)/D(v)) = argmax(c/D(v)) = argmin(D(v)).

Thank you!

I know the shuttle program was primarily scrapped due to cost but why are the new space craft being built by spacex and others following the design ideas of the apollo missions?

709,"How to interpret the of power laws in the spectrum of a time series (understanding white, pink, red brown and black noise)?",6,gnxgvp,askscience,6,"From my understanding if a frequency spectrum is essentially frequency independent then this is white noise. The interpretation being that there is no correlation in time in the data. 

&nbsp;

For brown noise, such that the frequency spectrum has a 1/f^2 power law, this is interpreted as there is no correlation between increments. That is the signal is performing a random walk in time.

&nbsp;

How does one interpret the “various shades” of pink noise where 1/f^alpha with 0<alpha<2? I get the idea of for alpha = 1 then we have the same energy in each octave. But this does not really give a physical understanding in the same way as for white and brown noise."

I am a Data Scientist at a Fortune 500 company, with a PhD in Electrical Engineering. For the last 5 years, I thought myself Python and Data Science and progressed a lot in that arena. I wanted some change after 5 years in the same company and wanted to explore options. Amazon AWS Pro Serve sounded interesting as you get to work with different companies. I did not want to work on a deep Machine Learning Problem on my cubicle (after corona, for now home desk :) ). I was excited about meeting new people and potentially solving data problems for different industries.

Am I making a right choice? Is Pro-serve considered to be same with, say ""Applied scientist"" role in AWS (asking in regards to: 1) career growth, 2) reputation and 3) financial) ? Is meeting new people and potentially gaining more exposure to different industries in Pro-serve a naive way of thinking? As we all know customer's behaviors can vary.

All in all I thought, exposing myself to people and industries, in the future I can perhaps even become an independent consultant, yes? Whereas If I am an applied scientist, I need to be deeply involved in ""creating the AWS tools from scratch"" vs using them in the AWS Pro-serve role.

If you have any experience with AWS Pro-serve data scientist roles, please chime in. Thanks in advance."

740,How to combine data science with data engineering?,0,hc83zi,datascience,3,"Hey everyone.

I'm about to graduate and get my masters degree next week and I have a tough decision to make. I've been working full time job for the last year in one of the biggest IT consulting companies out there as a big data intern, however my academic background is also more about analytics and statistics (i'm graduating in ""Computer Science and Econometrics"").

My main repsopnsibilites in current position are: building a star schema data warehouse (using SQL and Spark), bugfixes in existing tables, adding new source tables etc. I have never done any Kafka related stuff nor some extreamly-advanced pipelines using Spark Streaming or other tools. Most of them were quite complicated SQL queries (with over 1k lines of code). Within next 3 months the client I'm working for is going to be migrating from Hive to Snowflake and Wherscape, do you think knowing those would be benefitial to add to my resume? I would also learn some Amazon Athena and S3.

In my free time I often do kaagle competitions (just to test my skills and have some portfolio projects), prepare some ML models, try to do some predictive analysis. I really dont want to let those skills ""fade"" and develop in analytics as well.

All the technologies/languages I have worked with are: SQL, Python (more analytical python, so libraries like: numpy, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas etc.), R (although I hate it), Scala (basic scala to understand Spark better), Spark (also pySpark), Hive (Hive-QL), Apache Ariflow (althow I know how to trigger a job and read logs, not really how to write complicated scheduling scripts), Jenkins, Git, Jira.

Now, I really have a tough decision to make. Should I stay in my current job as data engineer (with promotion to regular engineer, not an intern anymore) or look into more data science field. What do you guys think would be more lucrative within the next 5-10 years? Is there any way I could lets say, within a year or two, easily change fields from data engineering to data science? I guess I would be pretty good at data preparation and cleaning in that time. Is knowlege of those technologies mentioned above superficial in case I wanted to change? Should I learn anything specific? Also, if I decide to stay in the current position, I can take certification exams in SQL and Spark. Would it be benefitial in data science? What would be the best path to take?

743,Position focuses mainly on “explaining drivers”,3,hc55m5,datascience,8,"Hey everyone,

I work as a DS for a fortune 100 company. It’s my first data science role and I’ve been here a little short of a year. We have no way of implementing models and I’ve built a few production worthy scoring engines. The company is trying to get up to speed with analytics and data science but is still behind in the curve in terms of technology and utilizing data and their data scientists.

This leads to my question. Is anyone else in a role where you are “looking for drivers” or “key factors” regularly. It seems as though this is a huge majority of the work and all people care about. “Looking for segments” or “tell stories”. It seems extremely trivial and the amount of work reducing extremely wide datasets to a selection of variables that can tell a story is a relatively big task. They’re so open ended and can tend to be misleading. This feels like more of a business analytics role (even though so many titles seem arbitrary). They’re looking to have a production ready environment by the end of this year but it seems that actually having the business utilize scoring engines is unlikely. 

Doing these segmentations or “drivers” of events is what stakeholders care about. Is this very common in data science? Am I looking at this position wrong?

* Is base CPU speed important? Number of cores? Threads? Cache?
* I know with R, enough RAM to fit datasets into memory and work with them isimportant, but does additional RAM beyond that help? What about RAM speed? (e.g. would 2400MHz -> 3200MHz make any difference?)
* Does the motherboard matter at all, aside from having enough space for future RAM upgrades if needed?
* Does the GPU matter if you're not doing deep learning?

I'm not working on cutting-edge stuff really but what things should I bear in mind for speeding up 'normal' data science work, e.g. data manipulation, statistical tests, visualizations, cross-validation & grid-searching (I use some boosting like xgboost & lightgbm but a lot of more standard linear/tree-based approaches)

As a programmer, I migrated away from excel and have a lot of automation using things like Jenkins for devops/data pipeline things and R Studio and Shiny apps to create apps for visualizing and working with data.  I do a lot of data engineering in oracle, creating repositories for internal apps and to serve to other enterprise apps outside of my department.  And lots of analysis via PLSQL queries against our database that runs our business.

I have practically no experience in Machine Learning or Neural Networks.

Most folks are classified as business analysts here.  Which is a range of people who use the gui of our business system and configure it via gui prompts, to devOps and our front and back end developers.

I tapped out of the front end game as data was my thing.  (Im way above average with my SQL and subject matter expertise of Oracle systems) And over the last year have really been learning R and Shiny apps to where we have a lot of real time dashboards and metrics to view (some on always on wall displays).

I mean, yeah NLP is going to make huge advancements in that span of time, but I don’t suspect it will be “smart” enough to devise its own methods to answer any type of question about a customers account by then. I foresee a nightmare of declarative rules driving hobbled together screen scraped-key logged RPA trying to interact with our 35 year old customer transaction database.

I mean, our IT department keeps pulling corrupt RAM on VM host hardware that out of warranty with nothing to replace it with. They don’t have the budget and we can’t get budget for cloud instances.

765,Monte Carlo (or other methods) for Ingredient Concentration Estimation,2,ha85yi,datascience,6,"Weird title but hear me out.

**THE PROBLEM**

I have a sample product that is comprised of let's say 3 ingredients, each with concentrations listed in ranges of the total product composition:

&#x200B;

|Ingredient|min concentration (%)|max concentration (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|x|25|50|
|y|25|50|
|z|25|50|

Now based on the concentration of each ingredient, the overall product is going to have a different toxicity profile.

If x = 50% y = 25% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of say 100.

But if x = 25%, y = 50% and z = 25%, then the product has a toxicity score of perhaps 75.

This is a real world problem (ingredients are often listed in ranges), so I guess I can assume normality of the distribution of each ingredient range (or uniformity?).

**WHAT I WANT**

I want to show a probability distribution of overall toxicity, based on some simulated concentration values. Maybe making 1000 potential ingredient ""configurations"" and then running the resulting calculations.

I have a database of \~20 variables that are collected continuously over time. This database is essentially measuring the conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field (too complex to model) which drives numerous phenomena that occur in the Earth's atmosphere, etc. These phenomena are of interest to researchers but only occur ever so often. To find these, you have to manually search years and years of data, something that is simply not too practical.

I want to develop some sort of method to take a number of instances of a phenomenon and search the continuous database for more instances. I think that this needs to be split into two tasks.

1. Discover common patterns (dips, spikes, sign changes, or even more complex ""shapes"") between the inputted instances. It will also have to discern the variables of interest because not all in the database will drive a single phenomenon. Moreover, if the program can then output these relationships (such as variables appear to drive the phenomenon) this will be of interest to users.
2. Use these relationships to search the continuous stream for more instances.

Like I mentioned, I am not very experienced in data science. Of course, I am not asking anyone here to develop this for me or anything, but it would be really helpful if someone could point me in the right direction. Eventually, I would like to develop some sort of robust methodology that can be applied to many scientific fields.

I'll start with the **things that made my life easier:**

1. [End-to-end Machine Learning App](https://www.ahmedbesbes.com/case-studies/end-to-end-ml-app). This is a great resource. It goes through the full process of building a Machine Learning application in a realistic setting. Most of the materials you'll find out there will skip deployment or work with simple data sets. This one goes from scraping to deploying in AWS. A few days ago, I also read [this one](http://veekaybee.github.io/2020/06/09/ml-in-prod/), which I also recommend.
2. [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). I compared Streamlit and Dash and went with the latter for better documentation and a more significant community. The deployment part was especially painful, so proper documentation was critical to get the job done.
3. [HugginFace's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/). If you are working with NLP tasks in languages other than English, check HuggingFace's repository of community models. Furthermore, it is relatively easy to integrate into an inference service built with Pytorch/Flask.
4. [Abhishek Thakur's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPRJjIWfyNG4X-CRbnv78A) and [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/notebooks) for fine-tuning BERT. Fantastic resources that saved me a lot of time. Especially when using those ideas with a pre-trained BERT in Spanish from HuggingFace's transformers.
5. More generally, I benefited from keeping the toolset simple. I used PowerPoint when I started designing the app (see the initial design [here](https://twitter.com/_dylancastillo/status/1272238506916675591)), SQLite as a database, and Python/Dash (instead of JavaScript).

Now, the **things that I wish I had done differently:**

1. Contain the scope. I started with a straightforward idea and then started adding stuff that just made my life harder. Most of the time, I think it was because I felt the app was not ""complex"" enough for publishing it.
2. Deployment. Ha! The only good thing about it's that it ""works"". Right now, it is a painfully manual process. I should have gotten to a better deployment process from the beginning. By the time I started deploying, it felt like too much work.
3. Sacrificed code quality. I wanted to ship this quickly. So the code is not DRY. It's more like CRY yourself to sleep. Refactoring is among my top priorities now.
4. Model. It's not great right now. It only gets the job done. I did not dedicate that much time to labeling data for fine-tuning the model. This is also a priority for me right now.

Finally, there are many things for which I don't know if I was following the ""best practices."" In particular, setting up NGINX and Gunicorn felt a bit *hacky*. Sooner or later, I guess I'll find out.

EDIT: Just noticed the big typo on the title. Sorry! haha"
773,From Data Scientist to Machine Learning Engineer,214,h9p4kl,datascience,71,"I'm currently working as a Data Scientist and would like to move full time to Machine Learning Engineer roles. What is MLEngineer's day to day like and more importantly how can I bridge the current gap. You can consider my skillset as Data Scientist specializing in Machine Learning. I used to deal with AWS, ML.

It would be great if you can provide some resources for those skills too. While my current role is like Data Analyst on steroids, my previous role was primarily ML.

One of the gaps that I identified personally is ML system design. I have never heard of it before and haven't seen any resources. It would be great if you can provide some resources for that."
774,Conducting a literature review - how do you guys use data science techniques to accelerate your exploration of a domain?,10,h9j7rq,datascience,3,"I am conducting a literature review right now and it occurred to me a lot of you guys must be using data science to accelerate this process e.g. using techniques to identify keywords which could help explore new areas.

So I wanted to ask:  What ways are you using data science to conduct a literature review?"
775,Do you sometimes wish you could do data science as a hobby rather than a job?,5,h9g8z1,datascience,3,"I'm working for an R&D tech company, and my team is developing a niche NLP product. I have developed a serious interest in NLP, but I secretly wish I could use NLP for my personal projects (of which I have plenty of ideas), rather than my job. Some of my frustrations of the latter include:

- Having to read so many badly-written papers and repos. Furthermore, I find the leaderboard chasing and the Frankenstein deep learning models quite off-putting (do we really need transformer + CNN + multi-task learning + multi-lingual model + dual-encoder evaluated on 10 different datasets without any deeper analysis within a single paper?).
- Many of the deep learning models might work well in some leaderboard, but incorporating them to our data is rife with logistical and performance issues. Worse is that most of them are just black-box models with little means to debug if they return a wrong result.
- I'm not really interested in the product that we're building so much that I'm willing to go all in with regard to the above two points. I keep day-dreaming about the NLP projects that *I* want to build and the interesting NLP papers that *I* want to read. Worse is that I'm often so burned out at work that I find little motivation to do any further work on NLP after work.

Perhaps my grievances are with the R&D nature of my job, rather than data science itself. I recently interviewed for a product-focused data scientist role at another company, and my secret wish is that I could do the more ""routine"" data science at work (think regression, clustering, etc.) and do the more cutting-edge data science as a hobby. Does anyone share similar sentiments to mine?"
776,Keep a Brag Document,611,h96nz8,datascience,30,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think “Where did all that time go?”

Even worse, if YOU can’t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They’ll notice all the hard work you’re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you’ve written.

But we don’t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan’s blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you’ve achieved.

And these “wins” don’t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That’s definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don’t want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn’t actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let’s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There’s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you’re just stuck somewhere you don’t want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You’ll often find that they’re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn’t even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn’t mean it’s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other’s wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you’re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you’re good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You’ll both be able to identify areas in which you’re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that’s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think “Wait..what was the point again?”

By using your brag document to set goals, you’ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you’ll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

778,Laptop for a Data Science Program,0,h92wj9,datascience,8,"I’m starting a masters in data science program this year. My personal laptop is on its last legs so I’m looking to replace it before I start the program. I used to be a Mac person but have drifted away from Macs because my work laptops for the last 4 years have been windows/Linux machines. 90% of my work is done in the cloud so it’s really just a terminal but I’d like something decent still if I end up doing anything local like simulation work. 

My requirements are 16 gb ram,  nice ish screen, great keyboard, and maybe able to play a few light steam games. Right now my top choice is the  ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 7 (14”) laptop.

779,Data Preprocessing Technologies Question,0,h924uy,datascience,1,"Hey folks,

I'm working on a small dataset of audio wav files (about 8000 new audio files a day). There's a set of preprocessing and augmentation tasks that we perform on top of each of these audio files which in total take about 10s per audio file (we're using librosa for our audio processing tasks).   


Would like to make this applicable as a general discussion but with the following added notes

\- Assume that obtaining additional compute resources (on-premise or on the cloud) is not a problem 

\- Preprocessing must happen when all new files are collected and not as they are obtained

&#x200B;

What would be a reasonable set of technologies to use for a Data Pipeline in this scenario with the goal of reducing the total preprocessing time to under an hour (currently sitting at around 22 hours)?  


Thanks!"
780,Analysts Committing Data Science Fraud,32,h90bpz,datascience,21,"Has anyone had this discussion before? Is there a field threshold for what would be considered fraud? Sure, some people make mistakes and the empirical method always allows for correction, but what about people working in the field who are literal hucksters? Does anyone have examples besides mine below?

I’m talking about the likes of Siraj Raval, or worse, the nobodies at small to medium firms who fakes their way into roles and have no qualifications or backgrounds.

Example, an analyst where I work said this to me and firmly believes it, “statistics is just for making the data look good, the way you want.” When I heard that my jaw dropped. Here is a person working as a data analyst who believes all statistics is meant for it manipulating data to make it look “good.” I’ve also witnessed this analyst, in a presentation to management, display a bar chart with manipulated bins to make them rise along side another series, and then claim correlation! Also, they’ve used that word when comparing two separate pie charts! Manipulating bins to hold different ranges in this manner is surely fraud. Leaning on “correlation” for every chart you produce is just negligent. 

How does someone like that get into a role? The person who is their manager doesn’t know anything beyond that data science is the hottest thing and he needs one in his department."
781,"I'm offered a data engineer role instead of data science, should I take it?",198,h8yjdf,datascience,94,"I am searching for a data science role but got offered a data engineer role.

786,How do you make use of CLTV?,2,h8dmfq,datascience,4,"By CLTV I mean customer life time value.

I recently started a project to profile our customers. Essentially I'm trying to segment them based on behavior as well as create CLTV around each customer.

This is the second time I encounter this type of project and much similar to the last time, I don't have a good use case for segmentation and CLTV, other than looking pretty on the report.

In logic, high value customers should get better service, but in practice we don't differentiate customers because they all receive the best service we could (or try to) offer. And if we hope to identify potential high CLTV, then we run into the chicken-and-egg thing. Is it because we go the extra mile that turn a customer into high CLTV?

So I'm just curious if anyone also does CLTV and customer segmentation and what the use case for them would be."

Is there anything out there like this? As far as math/stats goes, although im decent at math, i'd prefer a book that isn't too advanced. If there isn't a great resource out there, would there be a good one for R that I can use? More concerned with the theoretical steps than the programming since I can always google which libraries to use.

Since february I'm working at a big company as an intern in a brand new data team focused on analysing data to identify suspicious behaviour in user accounts and devices. We spent a few months searching and configuring some tools to help us (Jupyter, Spark, AWS EMR...) and finally we made progress and have a good set of tools and some data (soon even more)! But the problem is: actually, we have little idea of ​​what we're doing.

798,[as a mentee] How to get the most out of a mentoring conversation,4,h78wsg,datascience,5,"Hi all! I am a new data scientist (< 1 YOE) who recently started a new role where I am the only data scientist on a team of devs/PMs … yes, I realized quickly the challenges working in isolation. Fortunately, I am at a company with many data scientists on other teams, so the isolation is not 100%.

I’ve already had helpful conversations where these data scientists \[outside my team\] share answers to questions like “what does your role look like”, “what’s something you knew when you first started” and other such broad topics. But these are one-time questions, and I am wondering how to maintain the relationship. **Specifically, are there more incisive topics that make sense to discuss over weeks/months? By make sense, I mean 1) enjoyable & organic for an experienced data scientist to share and 2) beneficial to a newbie data scientist?**

Put another way, the conversations I’ve had in this role are either 1) super technical (“maybe change the X hyperparameter”) or 2) super high level “I wish I had known X when I started”. I wonder if there are topics that are at an in-between level of technicality that feel natural for both mentor & mentee to talk about.

***I was thinking*** I could ask them to talk a bit about their current project, e.g. what kinds of data they rely on / what techniques have been most useful, surprises and pain points, etc. But I don't know if that is too much of an imposition, particularly since I'm not a team member and don't necessarily have full context of the problems they are solving (nor can I help them in return).

edited for formatting/clarity and to add: I realize I'm basically asking ""how do I talk?!"" but I am coming to learn that that's not such an obvious skill!"
799,Navigating Temporal vs. fixed data - interesting problem,3,h77p8s,datascience,3,"I have a dataset with counts of unique users per organization that use a product. The dataset spans \~4 years and is broken up by month/year. 

I want to calculate the % penetration (i.e. out of the total # of employees at an organization, what % use the product in a given month). Ultimately it would roll up to an analysis thats examines different points in time (i.e. 6 months after onboarding) and gives a % penetration number. 

This is an interesting problem because obviously headcounts for companies change over time. I was wondering if anyone has any interesting suggestions for how to navigate this?

Would you use a service where we can provide you with human labelling and management of your data sets? You pay a fee (similar to a VA) but we also provide job training to these folks. Of course, if they're really good you can even hire them directly.

801,how much face-to-face interaction vs. coding do you get at work?,2,h0zwvg,datascience,2,"Hi. COVID-19 aside, how much of your job is spent talking to colleagues compared to coding by yourself (or doing something else)?

I'm doing SQL grunt work and light data engineering, about two years since I changed careers (I'm in my 40s). It's fine for now. But even when we were working in the office, I had little face-to-face interaction with people. All the marketing analysts we work with/for are much more cheery and friendly with each other. I just spend a lot of time working on code by myself. 

I don't regret any career choices - just realizing that next year when I look for a new gig, I need to take this into account.

802,Autoregressive model with an exogenous variable?,2,h0thd1,datascience,11,"Before I start, I should say I’m an engineer rather than a data scientist, so please excuse any ignorance on my part.

I’ve got a univariate time series - a bunch of physical measurements which describe the performance of a machine I’m working with. This data has a cyclical pattern. What I’ve seen is that the measurements are generally high during the middle of the day and low at night. Given my understanding of the equipment, I believe that the data is influenced by both the ambient temperature (it’s outside) and by its internal state or past performance. I’ve looked at PACF and ACF which supports the latter.

What I want to do is build a model which will estimate its performance at t0 given measurements at t-1 ... t-n and the ambient temperate at t0. That way, if the estimated performance is way out of whack from its actual measured performance, I know something unusual is happening and I can schedule a maintenance inspection.

A plain old AR model might be sufficient, but that doesn’t take into account temperature. I’m thinking about training an LSTM model, but that seems like overkill. Are there any other models I ought to consider? Some other way I can use temperature data to improve the estimate I’d get from an AR model?"

Service A requires a lot of equipment and people who are skilled in operating that equipment. He has his own large inventory of equipment but once in a while, he gets an event with a large scope, wherein to be able to provide that service, he has to purchase more inventory, which might be used immediately or can remain with him for a long time.
He has employees hired to manage and deliver the service, but again if the scope of an event is large, he hires freelance manpower to execute and provide the said service.  

As a nature of the industry itself, everything is need-based. the way it usually works is:
A client (can be corporate or a wealthy private client) sends out a brief of what he/they intend to celebrate or organize an event -> This brief usually goes out to few event management companies -> these companies propose a plan/theme/budget -> client approves it/negotiates on a budget -> event happens.

Now, the event management companies can approach my friend for service A, either during the proposal phase or after the proposal is approved in which case they have already factored in a service A in their proposal and budgeted a certain amount for it.
Each approach by the event company is considered as an incoming inquiry for hiring his services.

My friend approached me if I can help him out in some way using data science. I have been thinking about but cannot figure out a an idea to model for. Whatever I do I want to ensure that it helps his bottom line. As you can imagine, the current pandemic has destroyed the industry and his business altogether, and since he has some time, he asked me for my help in gathering some insights which will enable him to tweak his processes for the future.

I thought of modeling for his handling of inquiries, wherein I can glean some insight into the probability of an inquiry turning into a business which helps him focus his resources on something which has more probability of generating revenue, but again he and his business are blind to what is going on at the event manager side, he only sees what comes to him and he keeps track of it.

There are other aspects of his business where I believe something can be done, for example, Inventory management & analysis, optimizing operational manpower (he uses inhouse and freelance manpower for his business), but these do not directly help in bottom line, they will help indirectly in a long term and I'm not discounting it, it's just not a priority for him.

So basically what I'm asking is, has anyone modeled for a business that is inherently unpredictable like stock markets and what would you even start looking at which will translate into the bottom line for the company. 

Any and all ideas are welcome."
804,Building analytics dashboard as a web app or use softwares such as Tableau or Power BI?,2,h0i4u5,datascience,19,"I am well versed in web development, so building a web dashboard won't be that difficult for me.

805,PhD by publication?,13,h0hrme,datascience,24,"I've seen people talk about ""PhD by publication"" or ""by published work"" - essentially a PhD that is awarded for a body of works published in peer-reviewed journals, instead of one thesis.

Anyway, I see this most often discussed in Arts/Humanities/Social Sciences. Do such degrees exist for Data Science or any of the tangential fields?

EDIT for context: I'm an MSc Data Science student, and I've decided to drop out of my programme. I've been miserable the entire 16 years of classroom education I've received, but it recently got way too bad due to how my department handled the COVID crisis.

The thing is that while I hate the education part of academia, I do want to do research. I already have one publication under my belt, which came from my Bachelor thesis. For now, my plan is to work in the field 0.6FTE and do research in my spare time - a PhD by publication would be a way for that to culminate in a PhD for me, without forcing me into a soul-crushing classroom."
806,Forecasting seasonally with alternative averages other than monthly.,1,h0hpnt,datascience,1,"Im working on a forecasting model dealing with call center data that is seasonal with about a years work of data. So far I've seen the data has a Coefficient of Variation (COV) of 25% across my monthly and weekly. I'm trying for precision so I want something lower. When I do ""day of the week"" averages, Mondays averaged with Mondays and Tuesdays averaged with Tuesdays..(etc) the COV drops to 11 - 15% now while I know COV isn't the be all end all and has a lot of assumptions caked into its use. I'm not familiar with a method to translate these with seasonal factors that are based on periods of time not in the daily form. 

Directionality is important. But if I have a clear significants issue I would like to know too. 

Anyone have any thoughts on how to achieve this or recommendations on alternatives that would yield more accurate results?"

810,Have you ever considered leaving the industry?,47,h03s6t,datascience,55,"I'm on my second job out of college making 160k not counting equity, etc. It's a rebranded data analyst job.

It feels too early in my career to feel burnt out, but I cannot overstate how bored I am. So much of the work is ""investigate why this metric moved in this direction"". It's not only incredibly boring, it's unrewarding: after hours or days of slicing the same data a dozen different ways, we rarely unearth an explanation, anyway. 

I'm tired of ad hoc analyses, but I don't want to go back to school for a master's to learn and/or be considered for ML jobs, either. It doesn't interest me.

I hear people talk about loving data visualization, or enjoying investigating and telling a story with data, and while I believe them, it's also kinda incomprehensible to me at this point.

**Have you ever felt burnt out? And/or have you ever considered leaving the industry?** 

What's stopping me is the thought of walking away from a (currently) successful career trajectory. I am unhappy, but I'm also aware that I'm privileged and may not be aware of the realities of other jobs. I would be very curious to hear how other people have weighed their options when considering leaving this industry (even if their desire to leave was motivated by something other than dissatisfaction)."

It's been just over a month in my new role in a new company. I'm the only data scientist in the organization, so I have no support and don't know if I'm doing things as I should, causing rework when I find a silly error. I feel like I'm missing out on valuable experience learning from a senior and am scared issues will come back to bite me when my models are put in production.

For a start, I have picked all interactions on relation to changing rate plan. Customers can use any channel to change their plan - web, app, call care support, chat with an agent, visit store etc. I am looking for a way to measure pain in their journey while changing plans - how much time did it take to browse plans and make a choice, was the app experience so bad that the customer had to call care center, were there any wrong expectations set or miscommunication that made the customer call back care after the change (issues with billing, device etc)

One way I thought made sense would be to use CSAT score, find correlation with features like time spent, number of calls or visits, number of times channels was switched, and try to come up with a way to quantify the pain experienced in each step.

820,The Future: Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production,21,gzcirb,datascience,11,"Hello everyone,

I've seen variations of the question ""What is the future of data science?"" asked before, but I think mine is unique enough that it would make for a good discussion in its own post. It's based on a 2020 RStudio Conference presentation mentioned in some other posts, called ""[Value in Data Science Beyond Models in Production](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/value-in-data-science-beyond-models-in-production/)"".

In the presentation, the speaker makes the case for why Data Scientists should focus their efforts on providing value through things ***other than*** deploying machine learning to production. As an aside, I think the definition of ""Data Scientist"" he is using is more of a Decision Scientist. The gist of his message is:

* Machine Learning Engineers are likely going to take the ML work that Data Scientists currently do, and will create off-the-shelf ML tools (e.g. AutoML), hence decreasing the need for Data Scientists to do ML.
* Data Engineers are already better than Data Scientists at cleaning data, building pipelines, and warehousing, and so this part of the data science process will be owned by Data Engineers.
* What work does that leave for Data Scientists? What the speaker describes sounds like the work of a Product Analyst:
   * Business Intelligence-type work (metric design, measurement, goal-setting, creating self-service data tools)
   * A small amount of ad-hoc ML modeling
   * Inform business strategy / product design based on data analysis
   * Experimentation
   * The human side of data work - ethics and communication

Here are some questions that the presentation raised for me:

* Do you think his prediction is accurate?
* Will the work of tomorrow’s Data Scientist be more like today's Product Analyst?
* Do you think his prediction is only true of the tech industry, or does it apply to all industries?"

**Tech. challenges I've yet to find a solution for:**

* How to best manage models that read/write from DBs best way possible?
* Efficient ways to automatically run tests on X independent separate ML models
* Best way to store and access (large) flat files

**Curious to try or work with**

* Kubeflow
* MLflow
* GCP vs AWS vs Azure vs Bluemix - Pros/Cons?

**Best advice**

* If you don't have one already - Design a standardised best practices handbook for your team. You should have a template for a DL project, as well as smaller ML projects. The template should be designed in a way that allows for easy reproducibility and productisation (See previous post I've written [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gw8z13/do_you_code_in_object_oriented_way_in_python_when/fsu2p8p?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))
* The rest of your organisation is not necessarily interested in what you are interested in. **Do not focus on mathematical rigor but business objectives.** 
* **Fail fast:** If you cannot get some value relating to the business objective out of the data, post cleaning of course, move on. Summarise findings and what you think is needed to achieve the sought after business objective (Additional data / Other data / Qualitative analysis - Shadow a worker in a function), hypothesise on the reasons for why the relation is not there. Ie. Maybe customers are price insensitive? Maybe they churn due to factors we do not have in the dataset?"

Any other tips to help transition the org to Scala? I don't want to be one of four data scientists writing Scala because inevitably some manager will tell me to conform and write pyspark instead.

829,Apache airflow,1,gy9ff2,datascience,1,"Hi,

I'm considering using airflow for my ML pipeline on AWS, and I have some questions about basic setup (perhaps noobish). 

I would prefer a serverless setup, but that seems out of the question in the cloud, since you have to host an airflow server?

The airflow server seems like a bit of an overkill, and I'm unsure how to control costs, scaling, python environments and memory/cpu/gpu requirements to each pipeline step?

Alternatively I thought about using it as 'command station', where the ML pipeline just delegates pipeline tasks to fargate and lambda functions - this seems nice, because I can get all the flexibility that I want using those other services, while keeping the server small.  


The reason I want to use airflow is of course because it seems awesome, and I would like to have that overview over the pipes etc. I could just setup a bunch of lambdas/containers, but I would never know if anything had failed.

836,Would it be foolish for me to turn down a (non-data) Tesla internship?,0,gxa6ex,datascience,6,"My undergrad and professional background is in industrial engineering/supply chain but I started grad school for data science last fall. I have always loved stats and programming which is what drew me to IE but felt like I wasn’t able to get roles that were analytical *enough* for my liking. 

This week I was able to secure two offers for summer internships (after weeks of anxious scrambling but that’s another story). One of them is Tesla. While obviously not a part of FAANG, I definitely perceive Tesla as at or just below that level. The only “issue” is that it’s not really an analytical role, it’s very supply chain oriented (like my background) with just one project with one of their analytics teams (which was a post-offer request from me). So like best-case scenario, the role is like 20-25% analytics, and the rest is similar to experience I already have. 

All I’ll say about the other offer is it’s a place that’s reputable but nowhere near the level of Tesla, and that the role’s primary function is about data management and analysis, more what I was hoping for. 

As someone who’s trying to break into the tech industry, is it foolish of me to turn down a summer at Tesla, even if the role is not very techy? It *feels* like it would open doors for me just on name alone. Or am I overevaluating the worth of such a role, and would make more sense to take the other role that’s more in the tech wheelhouse skillset-wise?"

841,Professional Data Scientists: How do you track your experiments?,4,gx04es,datascience,5,"Hi everybody,  
I need some collective knowledge on collaborative data science. Mainly what I am looking for is to get a better overview over my teams experiments / training of models.  


Our current state:  
We are currently training NN for Computer Vision using jupyter notebooks, csv files for labels and operation systems directories to store the images. People execute their notebooks and they sometimes get errors because someone else is currently training on that gpu (of which we have 2).

  
So what am I looking for?  
1. A data store for our datasets with some kind of data lineage. (Can be solved by postgres or what ever. Fair enough.)  
2. Provisioning of some kind of execution queue so that people can queue up their notebooks and have the results 24h later.  
3. A multi tenant experiment store (like model db, ml flow -- but I would like it to have support for multiple users).  
4. The possibility to review and comment on experiments so that we can assist and teach each other. Similar to how gitlab handles pull / merge requests.  
5. OpenSource.  
6. Optional: self-hostable for free.   


Multi Tenancy is a must for me. We need open discussions on approaches to Data Science / ML Problems. So is open source -- mainly for the same reason.   


Technologies I looked into but am very happy about for comments:  
Kubeflow, OpenShit/OpenDataHub, Mlflow, VertaAi/modelDb  


I have a long list of tools, currently I try to deploy pachyderm to take a look at it. Meanwhile I would be happy about your views, suggestions.

848,What is in your model check list?,9,gwiue7,datascience,6,"What are some of the things you do after fitting a model (i.e. regression or classification)? To understand the types of decisions it’s making, understand if it’s biased or overfitting, etc.? 

This is a pretty broad question but I’m looking to create a checklist of things that should be done ensure you have a “good model” 

Things like:

*Check the correlation between variables (heatmaps, VIF, etc.)

*Check the feature importance’s/model coefficients 

*Use SHAP values / charts to understand the directionality of model features 

*Plot the drop-off in accuracy when eliminating features (either through backward elimination or pruning the most important features) 

*Plotting interaction terms between your variables 

*Checking the model performance for different encoding strategies (one-hot, target encoding, etc) 

*Plotting performance by different subregions in your data  

*Compare different algorithms for performance"

&#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

I have taken a bunch of MOOC courses and had worked on common UCI datasets. I have recently started with Kaggle as well (trying the basic one's right now).

He just wanted to know my answer to the above question. I tried thinking and giving a generalized answer but he wasn't impressed and asked how did you solve iris problem. Having watched n number of tutorials, the bias kicked in and I just said that I need to do EDA, understand the relationship between parameters and then go about solving the problem by applying, any of the many Classification algorithm, which I had done.

But he wasn't having it and this got me thinking that in the real-world you won't be given a dataset to work with, forget about proper expectation/requirement. And you cannot waste/invest a lot of time doing EDA as the client is looking for a working model and not a bunch of graphs and visualizations, so how to actually approach a ML/DS problem?

870,"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.",661,gv3i57,datascience,102,"&#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting"

There were numerous issues: which features were most important, did it make sense to have so many features, do we condense them, do we take the mean and so on. I had been working on this problem for weeks, and after numerous measurements, reports, reading and testing, I conked out -- I gave up. 

Man, Data Science was done for me; I was so over it. I started talking more with my colleagues in different departments, primarily in PR. I just felt like doing something else for a few days. I asked one of my colleagues in PR, ""so, what would you do if you had to rank X, Y, and Z?"" ""Hmm... I'm not so sure, I think I would be more interested in Z than X, why is X even necessary?"" She was right. Statistically, X was absolutely necessary in many of my modes. My boss thought this was the key to solving our problem, why would she think it's unnecessary? It turns out... as Data Scientists, we weren't the ones using the product. My colleague -- bless her soul -- is exactly our target audience. We were so in solutions mode, we forgot to just think about the problem and WHOM it concerns. 

I decided to take a walk and put pen to paper. I even asked the barista at the local cafe. It was so obvious. 

We were solving the WRONG problem the whole time -- well, at least we weren't making it any easier for ourselves.

To all of the great DS minds out there, sometimes we need to stop and reset.

So we’re looking to cluster our social demographic data. I’m pretty new to clustering validation and when to say, “this is good enough.” 

We have no pre labeled data to test our clusters,  only silhouette scores of ~ 0.65

At what point do I stop optimizing clustering problems, or is it subjective? 

For some background on the problem: 
We aim to label the data into 5~6 clusters (domain knowledge from my boss suggests in theory there should be 5~6 categories. Will discuss with him more), 

We wish to use the data to synthesize new data. I’m not too sure how we will achieve this, maybe a variational Autoencoder, or we simply find the closest centroid for data of our choice and sample from the centroid (this is the added restriction that our data is distributed in different ways as we are working with real estate data)

Given the problem, I’d say it’s important we have very clearly defined clusters, but

I work as a data-scientist in a junior position. My typical workflow consist of the following steps :

 1) the client gives us a problem 

2) think about proper methodology 

3) gather the data necessary to solve the problem 

4) apply some statistical procedures to solve the problem (generally a model) 

5) build a report to send to the client (this report must follow the company's format and standards).

One aspect where I notice I am having difficulties or improvement are in what I will call the non-technical or non-statistical aspects of the workflow above. That is suppose you gather the right data and think about the proper methodology to solve the problem, but then how can I prevent errors on the coding and reporting, for instance:

\- you have the right methodology, but when you are coding the model you assign a wrong variable in the code in some step and then the results are not valid ( for instance you have x\_train and x\_test and you mistakenly do m = x\_test / 2 instead of m = x\_train / 2).

\- on the reporting stage, you exported the wrong results.

These are just examples.

Then you send your report and under scrutiny from your managers or revising things to answer additional questions you find this errors. Then it looks unprofessional to say that the initial results were wrong and you will have to update it. It may not inspire much confidence in your results in the future.

It has been hard for me to find ways to improve in this aspect because these types of errors are hard to predict. When you are coding you are already doing what you think it is correct. Given the time frames we have, it is also unfeasible to double check every single line of code. Also, the problems are generally very diverse in nature, so it is not like you can just adopt an automated or semi-automated methodology that you can work upon and improve, many things you have to build from scratch every time you receive a new project.

877,How do you manage credentials/passwords for your data pipelines/ETL jobs?,27,gue1fu,datascience,6,"Hello, first time system architect here. Or rather, I'm just the most experienced dev so [they gave me the reins over the project architecture](https://i.imgur.com/43eedLE.jpg).

Anyway, we're building a data analytics platform and just finished our first pipeline that ETLs from a DB into our data warehouse. We were provided a read only account for that DB and initially, we saved the username and password in a gitignored credentials.ini file that we would manually copy paste during deployment.

We're about to start our second pipeline which will involve another DB and another set of credentials and it's becoming apparent that our project will eventually contain all the (read only) keys to the kingdom. We've switched to saving the credentials in a keepass vault (.kdbx) which is checked into our repository while manually copying the keyfile.

I understand that if we want these pipelines to be automated, those credentials are going to need to be accessible from within the system so really, I'm just wondering if there's a better way to manage the storage/deploying of them within our project.

890,I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,436,gtv2c9,datascience,40,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do & where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard & interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing & analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization & efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

891,Themes/Templates for plotly dash,2,gttm8e,datascience,1,I have to build a dashboard for one of my work projects. I have choosen dash as my choice. I was wondering if there are any themes/templates that I can use as the base and build on top of it.

892,Industry working professionals: What do you use to maintain different versions of models ?,8,gtt0sq,datascience,9,"I am working on a certain prediction based project. I now have 3-4 models and around 2-3 varients of each models (different hyperparameters, minor changes in architecture etc). Currently I am making a seperate folder for each model, sub folder for each of it's variant and maintaining a report (basically a summary table) of accuracy of models and other meta details. I realised that this approach is not scalable. What system/approach do you use to tackle this and reduce your stress in maintaining model versions ?"
893,Future of Data science?,2,gtrro4,datascience,11,"I've been reading about what the future will hold for Data science, and some of the stuff is bleak.

894,Clustering analysis for curves?,3,gtqxbu,datascience,14,Working on a project where I'm doing some curve fitting. Wondering if there's an easy way to group many separate results based on similarity? Either on a visual plotting of the curves themselves or on the underlying values (list of 100 numbers). Working in python but also know R if that's a better fit for this task.
895,EDA revisited,1,gtjczf,datascience,4,"As we know, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a very common procedure in the field. We use it mainly to find inconsistencies in the data, to uncover simple patterns that could alter our perceptions of what we are dealing with and to build insightful visualizations. I think we can all agree how this type of information can be critical. What I would like to do here, and I hope you bear with me, is to question what seems to me a overly optimistic application of this technique.

So, a little context. I've been working on a small consultant startup that leverage data science techniques to serve our costumers. As you can probably guess, most of our services involve helping our clients make sense of their data and extract useful information that can maximize their profits. 

In the project I'm in, for 3 months we have been doing EDA and communicating our results through Power Point presentations. Although sometimes we could find something that was potentially interesting, this experience left me questioning the value of EDA when applied in isolation. 

To explicit my argument, let's go through an example: suppose I have a database with 20 variables and my goal is to find ""something interesting"". What we usually do is trying to find correlations between these variables (be it in form of graphs of statistical tests). Suppose that I find a positive correlation between X and Y, though. What is this really saying to me? How is this accounting for confounding variables and how much variance is it capturing? My bosses don't seem to me very concerned with these questions and usually think the finding of a correlation is already an insightful thing to communicate. 

I have been trying to argument with them that no analysis could be detached from previsibility. If this variable is correlated with the outcome, but it isn't helping to predict it, then why are we so focused on it? My concerns are usually met with the same answers: ""it is important to visualize what is happening"", ""we are still exploring our data"". 

This makes me think that my approach (predictability in the first place) is kind of unusual in the field? It appears to me that EDA has became a branch of data science that is not connecting very well with everything and is becoming embedded in some other kind of rules? 

I would love to hear your opinions about it."
896,Interview at Amazon for Data Scientist Role -- how to prepare?,278,gthgfw,datascience,120,"I am currently a Lead Data Scientist at a large defense contractor, primarily applying data science solutions to business-facing homerooms. Think supply chain, business management, etc. 

A few highlights about me...

* Very strong SQL skills, and I have done a large amount of data ETL
* Moderately strong Python skills
* Top 1% on Stack Overflow (I answer a lot of SQL and Python questions, also ask some)
* Nearly 10 internal Trade Secrets awarded to products I have built
* B.S. in Information Technology, I am graduating in August with my M.S. in Computer Science w/ an AI concentration from Hopkins
* About 3.5 years of work experience out of undergrad, two internships at Defense contractors before that
* Also have security related certifications (Security+)
* I mentor both the cybersecurity and AI clubs for my high school (along with a few other alumni)

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for. However, the recruiter mentioned almost 60% more than I make now, so that was enticing.

I feel technically sound -- but I definitely don't know how succinctly I could give an answer to some technical questions. I've looked at:

Are these good resources? Should I be prepared to write an algorithm from scratch? Would it be easier things, like kmeans, or am I expected to code backprop from scratch? I've done these things from scratch before, but I used reference material... I am nervous about not being able to demonstrate my skills because of being too focused on providing these overly technical answers.

Any advice is appreciated!

Edit: Wow! This blew up. I certainly was not expecting this much feedback, and certainly not so much kindness. As a somewhat new graduate ( < 5 years) who is still figuring out their own self confidence, getting to share a little bit of my background and my fears moving forward with you all has been cathartic, not to mention the sheer volume of incredibly useful feedback I have gotten. I am going to think some thing through tomorrow, and I'll be sure to update this post.

897,How do you answer behavioral based tech questions if you work in a calm job environment?,7,gtgcj4,datascience,14,"I feel my situation is a little unique. Work as the only data scientist for my company and pretty much any recommendation I put forward goes through without any push back from management. There are no conflicts etc as I'm the only data scientist and my manager is really chill so no tight deadlines and issues with management either.

My issue is that now that I'm looking to move to another company, the interviews require you to answer behavioral questions but with a technical aspect to it. I just don't know how to answer conflict or deadline or last minute change questions in a technical manner because I've never faced such situations at my current job. I don't know if i would be answering incorrectly in an over simplistic manner would be too simple of an example for the tech recruiter.

At this point i sort of have to come up with fake scenarios around my work to make it seem like there were conflicts and tight deadlines

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to frame my answers or create such scenarios that seem behavioral based but also technically challenging. Like what exactly do I talk about.. pvalues?? Feature selection?"

900,K-Means vs vector quantization,5,gt7wv3,datascience,2,"Howdy,

So, everyone knows about K-Means as a form of general clustering algorithm. Vector quantization is similarly centroid based, but rather uses a feed forward network to generate that Veroni styled segregation pattern via a (for lack of a better phrase) loser takes all output.

Is there any significant difference in these two algorithms? They seem like they would both have similar results; they both use random starting states, and rely on small adjustments potentially locking them in local minima. It seems like the only real difference is that k means is simpler, more efficient, and more direct."

902,Worst example of data stupidity you have seen?,103,gsqs45,datascience,78,"**It's Friday, lets vent!**

Will share my story but heavily changed to protect the guilty.  

I work(ed) in a safety field where people die based on decisions. We risk rate things, and use our limited resources to prioritise what we need to fix. For arguments sake, I have put this in the context of safety of vehicles.

Someone in another department came up with a subjective but otherwise understandable way of risk rating. Things  like 

* if there are seatbelts, subtract 1
* add the number of accidents in the last year
* if there is speed monitoring, subtract 1
* if no licence is required, add 2
* subtract 1 for every time they have been inspected  


As you can see, some of these were real numbers, some ordinal, some categorical and so on.

These numbers are added to give a final ""risk"" score for a vehicle. So far, so dodgy.

However, this total ""number"" was then ranked, and then multiplied by the number of passengers to give an overall value, which was then multiplied by the amount of safety dollars we had to spend to work out what we should do.

Needless to say, my mood quickly went from appalled to ""holy shit we need to never let anyone outside the organisation see how we do this..."""
903,"Just sitting around, waiting for my data to load...",0,gsnbun,datascience,6,What’s your favorite ETL tool?
904,Well today was a depressing day for data science at work. What can I do better?,380,gsn5lz,datascience,269,"I work as an Analytics Manager and normally I don't really share with my colleagues the in depth details of my work because nobody is technical. They just know I use SQL and Python to spit out a report and that's all they really understand.

Recently I had an opportunity to do something interesting where I had a very skewed data set and was asked to make sense of it. I thought applying a log transformation to normalize the data as the distribution was extremely skewed and thought it would make the data easier to interpret and I was happy with the results.

My colleagues wanted to know how I arrived at my conclusion for my recommendation so I walked them through the process. I provided a high level overview, but they really wanted to get into the nitty gritty of exactly HOW I got to where I got. Again, I normally don't like to do this because they tend ask very detailed questions like ""Can you explain exactly how this works so I can understand?"" and it gets tough to explain certain things (e.g., I would say something like ""I got this raw data from the API"" but then it's followed up by a question like ""What is an API and why didn't you just use the vendor's dashboard? Why doesn't the vendor's interface provide the data? Why do you have to go through this step?"").

Well anyway I was explaining my logic and really tip toed around the stats by really trying to say essentially that I applied some logic that would more even distribute the data. I stupidly said the word ""log"" and it was over. Their faces froze for a good 10 seconds before someone spoke.

""I'm sorry..but what? What is log? Why do you need this log? I'm really confused. How am I suppose to explain this to the SVP? Can you just change it so you're indexing off the median or mean? This doesn't make any sense.""

I'm dead.

So guys, how do you avoid getting away with having to explain things by  not using technical jargon? I mean like I said, I normally just show people the output of my report and I don't get too many in depth questions about it, but when people really pry, it gets tough. I don't know how to avoid saying ""I ran a regression model"" because it freaks people out and they get upset because they don't understand it and want me to do something that is easier to interpret. It's already frustrating that they think I'm over complicating things by using Python instead of Excel, but I can at least tell them certain things like Excel can't handle 1+ million rows and they can understand that.

EDIT: Hey all, appreciate all you feedback, both positive and negative. I think it's all constructive. There's a lot of replies in this thread so it's hard to answer everyone's questions. Some of you ask the same things and I do answer them, but you might have to dig through the comments to find it. In any case, let me post some frequently asked ones:

1) Did you use graphs and visuals?

Answer: I did. I actually stayed away from using the word log at first and just showed them a histogram of what the data looked like before the log transform and then after the log transform. What followed up was ""How did you do this? What did you use to index the numbers?"" And that's when I mentioned I used a log transformation.

2) How did you explain what a log transform was?

Answer: I didn't directly explain it in math terms. I described it in the form of an analogy or comparable example. This is what I said: 

""Imagine we were looking at salaries for a company. Most people for example will make a salary between something like $40 - 100k right? Well what if the top execs in the company make like $10 million dollars. Now imagine you tried to index using the mean? Wouldn't the mean say the average employee at this company makes a salary of $1 million dollars or something? That's not right. Basically, a log transformation would keep everyone's differences in consideration, but minimize the importance of some of those execs who are not entirely representative of the rest of the company. That way you can better see the difference in salary among every worker and not have your vision obscured by some of these execs who are throwing off that balance. ""

Unfortunately, this proved to be even more confusing and my colleagues really zoned in on exactly what a log was and how it's calculated and it was tough to navigate from there.

3) What is SVP?

Answer: It stands for Senior Vice President. It basically is a reference to our execs."

906,Convention on Multiple Imputation for ML models?,6,gsgcup,datascience,6,"Hi guys, I'm trying to build a binary outcome classifier for a dataset and I'm kind of stumped by a particular feature in the data which have \~20% of its values missing in both the training and testing sets. This feature has about a r=0.077 correlation with the outcome (measured from observed data in the training set).

I'm looking to do Multiple Imputation on the missing values and I gather that I basically need to do the following:

1. Choose a single imputation method with a random component (regression with random error term, regression with bootstrap samples, etc.), impute missing values x times to get x separate datasets
2. Do my analysis (build an ML model) x times to get x different sets of results (model parameters)
3. Average the results to get 1 set of model parameters

I was wondering if it would be okay if I just did step 1 and averaged the missing values into 1 complete dataset? I ask because this seems like it may not be worth the hassle for something with only a r=0.077 with the outcome, and coupled with missing values in other features I would end up with a lot of models if I chose this approach. Is there a better way to do this? Also how would this approach work from a testing point of view? Would I just impute multiple testing sets and take a majority vote of the predictions?"

919,Cloud permissions for Data Scientists - anyone happy with their company's setup?,81,grmbms,datascience,48,"A recurring issue I've had to deal with in my career has been IT governance and the ability of myself (or my teams) to be able to use or test out cloud functionality independently (i.e., not needing IT to set everything up for my first).

For those in companies with tight permission policies:

1. How is your access to cloud resources set up?
   1. Are you able to spin up compute resources by yourself (e.g., EC2)?
   2. Are you able to connect these compute resources to production DBs, or are you only able to create these in dev environments/connect to test/backup DBs?
2. Are you happy with it?

EDIT for clarification:

* I am not advocating against IT governance - I think it certainly has a purpose and just giving users ""God privileges"" as u/lacompacida so eloquently referred to is not the answer. What I am interested in is how others (companies) are managing the tradeoff between cybersecurity risks and data scientist's autonomy.
* For example, I think u/SlightBerry brings up what seems like a valid stance - users should be able to deploy resources as needed, and security should be handled not by overseeing what users are spinning up, but by making sure that whatever they spin up is isolated enough not to generate issues. I certainly have questions regarding that setup, but clearly there is a balance between giving any joe shmoe complete access to prod vs. requiring even your most senior DS to open a ticket to get a compute instance stood up."

934,How to determine the one optimal decision threshold across multiple predictive models,6,gpibk8,datascience,2," 

I am currently wanting to construct predictive models to identify patients who may have a misdiagnosis of a certain disease. However, the issue is that I have multiple databases and I do not want to combine the data into one set, so I need to create predictive models for each database. On top of that, I wanted to use different model approaches and use the most accurate model.  

I'm currently facing the problem of determining a way to identify the optimal decision threshold to categorize the results of the predictive model as having been misdiagnosed (p=1) or not having been misdiagnosed (p=0). I've read about how we can use Youden's Index to determine the optimal cutoff for a model, but since I'll have multiple models for each of the database, would it make sense to use the SAME cuttoff across all the models and databases or have one for each database (but keep it consistent for each model within the database)? I'm a bit lost on what the best approach is. I haven't been able to find papers that provide detail on how they determine optimal decision thresholds when they have multiple models

P.S. I've read about how you can use the cost of each result (i.e., TP, TN, FP, FN) to determine the threshold, but these values are unknown for my disease of interest.

I've been hearing polarising opinions on using using Jupyter notebooks in production. My read is that people generally agree on notebooks being useful for exploratory analysis, but the path from there to production seems very vague and very different for different workflows.

Here is what I've found quite useful for my team, made of data analysts, data scientists and me as production engineer. We start from notebooks and gradually end up with code in .py files. It usually involves a hybrid setup of Jupyter web UI and VsCode connected remotely to SageMaker machine, opening the same dir notebooks are in.

There is not quantitative data to back it up, but I feel it didn't decrease the iteration speed and it definitely avoids a lot of ""translation"" from what they write into production code.

What are your thoughts on this?

Do you do something similar?

Is your data setup so complex that it's almost impossible to move from notebook to the production code?

Just a quick one. What are the best drag and drop (or other user friendly) ML or Deep Learning platforms available in the market? 

I know of  Data Robot and Dataiku. What is your view of these and are there others? 

For context. I'm a startup owner (no technical data science background) and am looking to quickly create and integrate some predictive models into the platform we are developing. 

First prize would be to develop our own algorithms and analytics platform, but that will take time, so wanted to explore alternatives using existing platforms.

All thoughts and feedback appreciated!"

I've been struggling to define what kind of insights I want to get out of it, outside of the simple correlation between mood, physical activity and sleep.

958,Clustering a large dataset in python (sklearn),9,gmx51a,datascience,17,"I'm trying to cluster a rather large data set (~400k samples, somewhere between 20-30 features). The features are mostly continuous, although there are some discrete/categorical variables.

Because of the mixed data types, I'm not sure if k-means is what I want to use. I tried running a DBSCAN but after it was running for what seemed like forever I gave up.

What clustering algorithm is recommended for such a large number of samples? What would give me a reasonable run time, while also dealing with the fact that I don't just have continuous, numerical data?

For an idea of the data I have, it's basically information about customers. I have number of accounts (discrete variable), account status (e.g, Gold, Platinum, etc. this is my cateogorical) and then some other things like age/how long they've been a customer, how much they've spent etc. (continuous variables)."

960,Get Use Out of Exponential Probability Distribution,7,gmscll,datascience,10,"Hello fellow data people. I was recently working with a dataset I had cleaned up and filtered. Machine learning (Tensorflow, custum, Microsoft Azure), trend functions (linear, exponential, etc.), and a bunch of other forecasting techniques had terrible results (yes, I tried using autoregressive inputs). I then plotted the frequency distribution of the outputs of the dataset, only to find out that it is an exponential probability distribution. Basically, there's 8 billion 0s, 3 billion 1s, 1.5 billion 2s (they're count values). I was wondering what useful forecasting can even be done when a dataset looks like this. Honestly, I can't even imagine any useful summary statistics (like, ""Oh, great! I have a 90% chance of it being less than 2""). This is like the third dataset I've had that looks like this and I'm always lost when I get them (I've done hackathons in the past that have had this same problem). Any help would be appreciated."

See what I did there? I posted a link with a bit of an explanation. That's fine. If you want to know more, you have to go to their content on their site. We all do that in our social media feeds. Putting all their content on my site so readers don't need to go to theirs is theft. It doesn't matter if I put the attribution somewhere with the post. No permission=theft.

When another site wants to repost something I've written, they send me a message and ask for permission. That's been the way it is done for the eight years I have been writing. With a site like KDNuggets, I am always good with giving them the OK and not asking for compensation. Some major outlets will ask me to rebuild a post to appeal to their target audience. They have millions of readers. I do that for free too.

I have worked with consulting companies. They want content to drive people to their site as a form of organic marketing. It's usually pretty fluffy, buzzword bingo type posts. I get paid for that. If someone is advertising their services on the site, they are making money off that site and you should too.

I have worked with companies that make products. They want technical content to explain how to use their product in the real world. Again, they use that content to market their products. I get paid for that and you should too.

In the research world, works are cited. There can be a longer quotation from the original work which will have the primary authors' names next to it. Supporting works without quotes will be linked to at the end of the research paper. That's fine. Copy paste research, paraphrasing, releasing implementations as original works, all of that is plagiarism. That gets you blacklisted.

I have posted content that was very close to someone else's. They posted first. I issued an apology and a link to their content. It happens. The right response is to put your hand up and say, ""I messed up. I must have seen their post and that triggered mine."" No excuses. I felt like garbage for doing it.

Hopefully that helps. If you have any questions about re-purposing content, let me know."

They instead offered me a medior DS role: 65k base + 10% bonus + 18k RSU(annually, can vest 25% per year). I managed to negotiate the base to 67k. So in total the package is worth of 78k. The work content will be recommender systems and NLP. The interview went really well and I could tell that they wanted me. I also liked the interviewers who seems open and friendly.

I initially tried to negotiate a 10% raise on the base which I then lowered to 5% during negotiation (cause they said 10% would lead to a senior role) but eventually they come back with a 3% instead.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

Again, look at all the ORIGINAL SOURCES and AUTHORS linked to in every case.

I will use the site for personal purposes to save my own time; it got built as my individual RSS reader; I will return it to that.

I apologize to those authors and readers that were happy I had put in the work to create the content aggregation location and add more exposure to others' work. (with zero pay to me)

If you intended to be disruptive, trolling, punitive, and silencing, congratulations, job well done, not worth my time anymore. Honestly, I was getting a little tired of putting in the work anyway. Feel free to navigate the hundreds of sources on your own (yes hundreds); it should only take you 10 or 12 hours a day.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

Haven't found a job on that (so no experience) and recently found a position at the current workplace involved with Risk (might not have ts either). Seeking for advice. 

Hello everyone! 

I'm a DS working at an important Bank in my country. Here I've been dealing with solving problems with unstructured data, like videos, images and text. It's being interesting, but I feel quite unsatisfied. I mean, I studied economics and I'm doing a MSc in Statistics. I love time series in a theoretical way, since I can't find a job that works with them. 

I thought that working at a bank would be cool and have some forecast related projects I could work on... but I couldn't work on any.  

You see in my department there are many areas for data analysis, but not for data modeling, except mine and other. The other area makes churn models, and sometimes recommendation systems. 

I feel I'm taking a wrong path for my future. I have no finance related experience (images, text?) Neither time series Modelling experience (aside from the theoretical one). 

I want to change and I recently found a position at the bank that deals with Risk and I think I might go for it (it's no time series related, but is bank related).  But my boss and the director of the area I work on don't want me to move. They say they really like my work, and that we have many projects we can work on, particularly since my area is gaining a lot of credibility. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if the position in Risk involves modelling and predicting as much as I'd like, or if it will just be analyzing and giving back raw numbers. 

Should I stay and keep looking for TS related jobs, or change to the Risk to gain insights and learn from the bank duties and may find place for forecasting? Should I just take this, grow in this side and hope to find something in the future? 

I'm very confused. And I think that this decision could impact my future, my happiness and many things in my life."
974,What setup should I use for matching and monitoring this project?,0,gktz5p,datascience,3,"I need to establish a framework for formatting, matching and tracking changes to a dataset that can only be accessed through a CSV-file. I know how to do that using Excel and VBA, but I was wondering if there isn't a better way.

The problems goes:

1. The goal is to gather a weekly COMPANY : SHARES summary (could be limited to 30 pre-selected companies).
2. Twice a year I get a COMPANY : FUND overview.
3. I can pull an extensive dataset (around 54k obs) structured as FUND : SHARES, but the dataset FUND-string often also includes a lot of noise, such as the company address, company name, telephone etc.
4. To aggregate COMPANY : SHARES, I thus need to match COMPANY : FUND by scanning through the dataset FUND string and match with keywords relating to each specific company (such as a fund name, or the company's own name).
5. Because of the bad quality of the dataset, I will need to manually look at the results of the sorting to adjust the keywords for faulty matches, e.g. a new fund has been attributed because it matched with the company name keyword, but the string also includes some info which makes it clear that it shouldn't have been matched here so I include a non-match keyword filter it out from being matched with that company. This is unfortunate, but bearable as a total of \~200 funds are matched if the number of companies are limited to 30.

I know how to do streamline most of this process with some hassle using Excel Power Query for formatting and importing the CSV, VBA for for matching the data and a Pivot Table for creating a summary. I also know some Python and have SQL experience. I see how SQL would ease the sorting, but I would still need to manually download and format the CSV before feeding it into, say, MS Access. It would be so nice with a setup where I could more easily set the company match/don't-match keywords, see exactly which rows has been matched per company from the dataset, adjust keywords and re-run, and maybe even point out new matches that wasn't there last time it was run.

I would be very grateful for any tips or ideas."
975,"Dealing with ""conditional"" features",9,gktrxo,datascience,25,"I ran in to this problem trying to build a model to predict loan defaulters using credit history features. A few of the features are of the format ""number of months since X"" where X could be the borrower's last late payment, last account of a particular type opened, etc. Some of these seem like they could be strong features, but have many missing values (with good reason). For instance, ""months since last delinquency"" feature only applies to those borrowers which have a delinquency on their record. Imputing a value of 0 would imply those with no delinquencies are the same as those with an extremely recent delinquency, and imputing a very large value (say 9999) just doesn't sit right with me. My only other idea was to introduce an ordinal feature instead of a numeric one, binning delinquency recency by say ""never"", ""<1 year"", ""1-2 years"", ""3-4 years"" etc. The issue I have with that is I would be deciding the cut off points at the expense of granularity, while it may be better to let the module ""learn"" those cutoff points.

* exploration that leads to a feature shipped in a product
* explorations that never get shipped
* data analysis for debugging purposes. Let's say we run an A/B test and want to figure out whether we set it up correctly. We won't really share results outside of the team.

I guess different project will possibly get different answers, but let's kick off with these questions:

* where do you store the sidecar data? We store the code on GitHub, but don't want to package the data with the code (security/compliance reasons)
* do you make all your explorations reproducible? For example, a piece of code calls the warehouse. Do you store the snapshot of the data somewhere so you know exactly what was analysed?
* do you store all analysis you perform? For example, exec asks you for some numbers for a PPT
* do you keep track of different experiments? What do you use for that? Notion/Confluence/Gdocs/something ML specific?

1. Does homecourt affect a team's chances of winning a game? I wanna see how homecourt affects a team's chances of winning a game, and predict the chance each hometeam has of winning a game. I believe it comes down to skill more than whether a team is the home team or not.
2. Predicting a team's chances of winning the nba draft lottery. Ik that have a worse record gives you a higher chance of winning the lottery, and thus, you get more ping pong balls in the draw.

However, especially when it comes to things like reproducibility in data science, it is important to get this right. 

I personally started out `pip install`ing everything into the base Anaconda environment. To this day I am still surprised I never got a version conflict. 

Over the time I read up on the topic [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) and [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and this got me a little further. I have to say though, the fact that conda lets you do things in so many different ways didn't help me find a good approach quickly.

By now I have found an approach that works well for me. It is simple (only 5 conda commands required), but facilitates reproducibility and good SWE practices. Check it out [here](https://haveagreatdata.com/posts/data-science-python-dependency-management/).

I'm taking a data mining course where we have an open ended project where we have to mine a given data set. It's a survey with about 2k users and 40x questions and I'm curious what yalls approach for coming into data sets like these and the approaches you'd use to mine. 

Note that I am NOT asking for help with my assignment. I'm rather looking for advice on practices and thought processes that professionals use for smaller more manageable data sets. I was going to sanitize the data and ingest it with pandas and then do some association mining to find similarities between users and some cluster to find similar groups. It'd be cool to hear the steps and considerations yall take and the technologies yall use!

1002,Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,362,gh3v0q,datascience,118,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions. The only thing I found helpful was doing some fancy visualization tricks through plotly. Is Kaggle just meant for beginners or am I using the platform wrong?"

1013,"Designing a Small, Scalable Data Pipeline on a Budget",6,gfwucw,datascience,21,"I work at a small, grassroots nonprofit youth center that provides afterschool and summer camp programming to middle school students in the inner city. I was hired on full-time as their ""Data Analyst,"" however, they had no prior systems, databases, or even spreadsheets, so I inevitably ended up becoming a one-man data team (which I actually am enjoying).

I built a small system of google sheets & forms to collect our student data (attendance, grades, behavior, etc), volunteer data (attendance, skills, etc), and program data (performance evaluation), but I would like to migrate to a more centralized solution that is scalable. The organization plans on scaling and replicating this model around the city, so it would be ideal to have a scalable, replicable data system to accommodate that goal.

My question is this: Are there any open-source/low-cost solutions for building a network of automatable data systems to fit this use-case? Something like a cross-platform app that we can read, write, modify, and delete data with and store in a sort of simplified document system like JSON or Firebase. Since I don't plan on staying here forever, I'd like to build it so it can be used by someone with any level of proficiency in programming.

1016,"I'm sick of ""AI Influencers"" - especially ones that parade around with a bunch of buzzwords they don't understand!",818,gfnax4,datascience,350,"This is going to come off as salty. I think it's meant to? This is a throwaway because I'm a fairly regular contributor with my main account.

I have a masters degree in statistics, have 12+ years of experience in statistical data analysis and 6+ in Machine Learning. I've built production machine learning models for 3 FAANG companies and have presented my work in various industry conferences. It's not to brag, but to tell you that I have actual industry experience. And despite all this, I wouldn't dare call myself an ""AI Practitioner, let alone ""AI Expert"".

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

I want more people to learn ML and Data Science, I just don't want them to learn snake oil selling.

1018,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,614,gf9hrs,datascience,56,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation."

1022,Is there an over emphasis on skills for hiring in this field right now?,6,gem4up,datascience,10,"My personal opinion is that there is an over emphasis on skills in interviews in this field right now. I get that hard skills are important, your SQL, python, R, Hadoop etc. However I have been on interviews where not a single question was asked about my past projects or the kind of person I am, my thought process, who did I have to work with to get what I need, how did I go from turning business requirements into project requirements etc. They were only interested in knowing my computer skills. 

I guess it would seem to me that hirers are forgetting that they are hiring a human being who is much more than computing skills?

I have a speech impediment which as expected gets worse during interviews as I have to think on my feet really quickly. I feel like I struggle with the competency-based questions, because due to my stammer I cannot use the STAR method correctly. Most of my feedback from the interviews were I wasn't the right candidate and other had fit the bill etc etc. ""you weren't confident, and they felt I wasn't strong enough"". I have never doubted myself nor have I lost confidence.

Especially during the lock-down, it’s hard for me to get an interview as most companies are closed and those that are still hiring start from a telephone call. In terms of landing an interview I have refined my CV with professional help and most interview reaches the face-to-face stage.

1027,Data Integration Help,1,gdyijn,datascience,7,"Hi!  I'm hoping someone can help me or provide some insight.  I work with a partner agency that is hoping to improve dataset integration. Briefly, they have one system that creates a user id and documents some information (this is related to covid testing and contact tracing). There is another system they use essentially like a service management tool. It takes data from system 1 (e.g. name, phone, tested positive) and uses this additional system to document case notes and provide service work updates (e.g. patient has not exhibited symptoms in three days).

Here's the issue:  the agency is manually exporting data from system one and uploading into system two nightly.  They use SAS for this, but i'm not sure how (I've only ever used SAS for analytics like MLR, cluster analysis, etc.).  

They need a faster and less manual way to integrate the data.  Ideally when one system is updated, the other is also updated much quicker than overnight and less manually (than export, import, matching, etc.).

I don't have a lot of specifics here; my agency was just brought on to help and i do not yet have information like metric names/types, job/etl schedule, etc.

Does anyone have any experience, insight, or suggestions?  I would appreciate it!
Thanks!"
1028,For those on the hiring side: how do you deal with incoming or prospective data scientists with little to no communication skills?,25,gdmn0f,datascience,28,"**BG:** I'm a director of data science at a global Fortune 500 firm and am constantly on the lookout for talent (barring currently with the virus).  I recruit pretty heavily with prestigious universities in the U.S. out of their data science programs.

**Issue:**  I find it is difficult as a needle in a haystack to find qualified data scientists with proper communication skills and general business sense.  Many of these recruits have their data science masters degrees and quite of few of them have their bachelors in some sort of business degree. Many others have engineering or statistical backgrounds.

I will often get a stack of dozens of resumes each with all the check marks crossed in terms of programming and courses but when I go to speak to the students it is a near disaster.  I ask them to explain very simple concepts and they often go off on 5 minute answers that are rambling and incoherent.  I need these candidates to be able to communicate across different sides of the business, often times with individuals that have little to no understanding of data science.  It almost feels like I need someone like the guy from office space that took the specs from engineers and handed them off to marketing or sales because the two sides couldn't communicate with each other.

**Q&A:** Has anyone run into similar difficulties?  How do you work with these candidates?   Do you hire them and then train their soft skills or do you only hire candidates with the full package?"

1032,"Data scientists/analysts who moved to Pandas from Excel, what operations do you find can be done much more easily in Pandas than Excel.",56,gd3b41,datascience,44,"Hello everyone,

I have been working as a data analyst for about 3 years and about 2 years ago I switched to Pandas due to how much potential it had to improve my life: I am very bad at cataloging and record keeping, so doing things in Pandas makes everything so traceable and reproducible for me. Plus Excel always becomes super slow for me when the rows surpass 80K.

This week I will give my team members a quick demonstration of Pandas's capabilities. A lot of my team members use Excel for most of their data analysis, so I'd like to show them some handy operations that can be done by Pandas in much shorter time, hence improving our efficiency.

Several operations I have in mind are:

* The magic power of `unstack` to move columns into rows, usually accompanying `set_index()` and `groupby`.
* `df.duplicated()`, esp if I want to find the rows that have duplicate values in some columns, I can do `df[df.duplicated(['A', 'B'], keep=False)]`
* I always have to write a pretty long formula in Excel to find values in column A that is in or not in column B. I love how I can just do `df[~df.colA.isin(df1.colB)]`
* \`merge\` compared to `vlookup` or `indexmatch`

That's about what I have in mind right now. Some other operations like drop\_duplicates() or sum()  can be done not without too much effort in Excel. I don't think I need to talk about groupby() as we all use SQL on a regular basis.

Would anyone care to give me some additional examples please?

Thanks for your time in advance!"
1033,Improving Presentation Skills,12,gd0wj9,datascience,13,"Hi everyone. Hope everyone is doing okay during these strange times. I have a few questions about presentation skills:

What kinds of presentation skills do you find most important to hone at work? What did you do to develop these skills? And finally, how do you deal with fear of public speaking? 

The latter is something I struggle with immensely. I spend a lot of time familiarizing myself with the topic I plan to present, organizing my materials so they “tell a story”, practice giving mock presentations and try to think of questions that the audience may ask. I feel comfortable with the knowledge, but find myself freezing up once I actually have to present. I’ve always struggled with performance anxiety. My heart starts pounding, my palms get sweaty, and I start getting tunnel vision. This seems to happen regardless of how much preparation I do.

Improving on this is one of my number 1 goals over the next year or so! If you have any advice or stories to share, please do!

EDIT: 

Thank you for the advice everyone! I already used some of the advice given here this morning for a mini presentation. I was still nervous, but the presentation went well overall and I feel better about it than I usually do! Baby steps, I suppose!"

1038,Leaving your datascientist position to create your own business - what are the key factor to succeed? what are the risks?,31,gcnojw,datascience,19,"I am working as a data scientists for a top strategy consulting firm. In overall, it is a decent job but I need to face reality, my company is not a tech company and I am bit concerned about the career path in the long term. Though the remuneration/benefits are good wrt to the data science market in my geography, I  feel that the analytics team members are somehow second class citizens wrt to the core consultants. They get huge bonus, we don t. They can make it to the partner level, we can't. 
The good thing about consulting is that you get exposed to a myriad of problems, so you get quickly get an idea of the needs of an industry. There are 2/3 use cases that come back frequently and honestly, the way we tackle these is pretty basic and leaves a lot of space for further improvement. Indeed, we are generally working on projects with very tight deadlines, pushing us to choose one-shot, quick-win approaches. As a consequence, we are constantly reinventing the wheel since most of the previous code base is too specific and can't be easily reused on a new project.
I am therefore sometimes thinking of leaving the company and create my own product. A better product that can be re used across use cases. 
I am therefore very interested to hear about similar experiences, to hear about people that have left their jobs to create their own business (ideally in the field of data science). Was it easy to find your clients? What are the key factors to succeed? What are the main risks (especially in these times of covid 19)? And how to survive  during the product development phase if there is no revenue flowing in?"
1039,Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,397,gc29zj,datascience,57,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

I would be happy to answer other questions if you have some!"
1040,Any data science jobs that are notably low-stress?,27,gc03ll,datascience,27," 

I've been a data scientist for about 5 years now. I like the math, the work, and the field itself, and feel good about my competency there.

1044,Work repeatedly lied to me about ability to transition and now I'm stuck in a role I hate with a bad economy,148,gb41m8,datascience,48,"Hello everyone,

So a bit of backstory. I started in my current role roughly nine months ago. During the interview process I made it extremely clear I wanted a data science position (particularly one that involved a lot of machine learning) but the recruiter said there were no openings on data science. She and the others I talked with did say my role would primarily revolve around deploying models into production and not building pipelines and I could transition to data science once there became openings. I did have another full-time data science offer, however it was in a different city. Therefore, I was faced with a tough decision and based both on location and their 'promises' I chose my current role. 

However, in the first few months after starting I realized three things: (1) I wouldn't be deploying any models to production as the DS team had absolutely no models past the prototyping stage (and nine months later they still don't), (2) several others were brought onto the DS team right around when I started, (3) several of the people on DS including the DS lead seemed extremely weak in terms of actual machine learning knowledge. In retrospect this should have been a red-flag but I still hoped I could move off of data engineering and get into data science going. (Also, several of my previous roles had been on contracts, so I wanted to hold down a position for at least a year and not look like a job hopper.)

 Throughout Nov/Dec I tried unsuccessfully to get put on data science projects. This was particularly frustrating as I have expertise in several areas of modeling where the company is struggling. 

Moreover, they transferred several engineers with absolutely no DS background onto DS just because they apparently had nothing better to do with them. However, they kept promising my time would come. Finally, in Feb/Mar they brought me on to a couple of projects aimed at the knowledge graph, apparently because I was the only one in the entire organization with NLP experience. I was happy to work on that but they made it clear that my primary responsibilities for the time being were still data engineering. I asked them if they had plans to hire someone full time to data engineering so I could move over and they said yes. 

Now to the present. They tell me to stop all data science work because they want me 100% focused on data engineering. They come up with some flimsy excuse about the economy and DE needing to be my focus. They also make some references to needing to improve my data engineering performance. (My performance review was perfectly fine. Plus I made it clear to them when I was interviewing DE/ETL was not my strong suit.) Moreover, they still apparently have the resources to hire a full-time data scientist (WTF? they couldn't have hired another data engineer and transitioned me).The data science manager (who still hasn't produced one concrete ML deliverable) literally sits as the product owner of data engineering. At any point he could have prioritized hiring another data engineer so I could move over. I'm beyond frustrated that they have lied to me since day one. However, now the economy is bad and I can't quit outright. I have had  a couple interviews, but I have a number of thing working against me (bad economy, data engineering job title, short current job stay)."

1050,Seeking Advice: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses and is pressuring me with deadlines. What to do?,243,gap9nc,datascience,76,"I work as a data scientist at a medium-sized company (with \~200 employees). I've been with the company for a little over 4 months. My salary is $90K/year in a city where the cost of living is relatively cheap. (For perspective, $1200/month for 2-bedroom-2-bathroom apartment.) I have a BI analyst as my boss and I have another boss who's a BI director.

The BI team in our office is small. Just 3 of us in the office. The issue I have is that my bosses don't understand the complexity of running a valid analysis, which is forcing me to cut corners and produce sub-par quality work. Those sub-par quality analyses then get criticized by people in other departments (e.g. finance people, data scientists in other offices, etc.) and it makes me look like an idiot.

Don't get me wrong. My bosses are hardworking, smart people. They can write complex SQL code and make stunningly beautiful Tableau dashboards. However, they don't have any statistical background to properly design studies and go through the proper procedures to come to accurate conclusions. But they care too much about how beautiful the presentations must be (font, color, company branding, etc.) and meeting deadlines instead of focusing on the important stuffs, like valid experimental procedures and properly separating out correlation from causation.

I would say that the overall company culture is very healthy. The CEO is super transparent about the company matters. Everyone is very open and caring. The company sent a lot of care packages during the quarantine for the employees and they also host weekly fun company-wide activities. They give great medical and health benefits as well as PTO.

I thought about quitting because not having enough time and resources that I need to do my job is making me look incompetent. I haven't quit yet because:

1. I don't think many other companies are hiring amid this quarantine crisis,
2. I have a criminal background so I'm not sure if there is any other company that's willing to risk hiring me.

What should I do? At this rate, I'm gonna continue looking like an idiot and maybe I'll lose my job.

TLDR: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses so I'm producing sub-par quality work. What should I do?

**TL;dr: DS job doesn't have ML/modelling work. Underpaid. Imposter syndrome kicking in. Want to switch jobs but afraid that I didn't build good experience to apply to bigger more challenging roles. Feeling stuck. Thinking of switching to swe since my statistics and ML growth hasn't been too good at current role. Need advice. More details below.**

I'm a data scientist, and I've been working on the same application for an year or two. I don't see it changing. Most of my experience has been writing spark code and  dev ops and cloud infra work for an application that we build. There's a bit of prototyping work here and there. And some business case development with upper management. The team is really small. And there are no senior members in the DS team. The only thing that I like about it is that I have positioned myself to become the most experienced person in the team on a product that we work on so i get to have a lot of say in the dev process.

I never go to do any ML or statistical modelling at this job. It was my first job after college, and I have severe imposter syndrome kicking in. So now I don't feel like a data scientist, and I'm becoming disillusioned with the field. My MS in data scientist is going to waste since I'm not using the ML and stats I learned. I am afraid to apply to other data science jobs since I feel that I will not be able to clear a DS interview round when it comes to describing what I've done with stats and ML and deep learning. I can study and practice sure but experience matters a lot, and if I don't have that, the only DS jobs I would be able to land in the future would be title inflated analyst roles.

I might switch to a software engineering role with maybe an ML focus because I fear I didn't build any relevant experience for the type of jobs that I want in DS but I have good experience and love writing python, plus coding in general. And I'm also tired of the lack of strong software dev practices in DS teams. I want to go somewhere where I can build things and code more than I do, with a more engineering focused team. Do you think DS jobs with actually challenging work will be harder to get into since I don't have modelling/ML experience?

My company is willing to start Green Card process, and then I'll be stuck here for a couple of years. At least my gc will process faster since processing dates for my nationality is current. It also makes staying at my current role more attractive since I don't know if newer companies would be willing to file GC straight away.

And then there is coronavirus.

I’ve interviewed some people who are Senior Level who cannot put together a coherent SQL statement and/or know basic functions. 

Which leads me to this question - do a lot of companies just throw Data Scientist/Analyst into someone’s title without knowing what the title/role entails?"
1062,Looking to pick up an additional language - I want to hear your actual experiences,0,g92fg6,datascience,11,"Got my first job as a data analyst in 2010.  Between then and now, as a function of 1) me moving up in the ranks, 2) macro changes in the entire industry, my bread and butter software went from Excel -> SPSS -> SAS and SQL -> Python.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm trying to be proactive, and start learning one or two new languages.

&#x200B;

I'm not looking for a ""you should just learn X"" answer.  I want to hear some ""IF you learn X, you could do Y.""  I'm more interested in finding a Y I want to do, and then I'll just learn whatever X I need to be able to do it.

&#x200B;

For example, I've been toying around with the idea of learning JavaScript, actually, precisely since most data type people don't know it, and I'm thinking that if I could do some cool interactive or data vizs or web apps, that could distinguish me from my peers.  So if I want to do more reporting and communication, JavaScript maybe would be the way to go?  Anyone have an anecdote that would back that idea up, or knock that idea down?

&#x200B;

Alternatively, I'm thinking about R and Julia.  Right now, I'm a data analyst who only knows how to pandas.  So maybe if I want to go more the science route, I should pick up R or Julia?  (Or: I'm thinking being able to use Shiny and ggplot would let me do more interactives/viz, so have any Pythonistas out there had their life changed by the R, in that way?  Can you tell me about it?)

&#x200B;

I also just started learning bash and awk.  Any data analysis type folks (but not database admin or ETL or IT type folks), discover that learning shell scripting solved a real problem they were having?  Enough to the point that its worth it to learn well?

&#x200B;

You get the idea.  I'm not trying to crowdsource An Answer here, I'm just trying to crowdsource Some Cool Options To Consider.

Do you just hard code a few edge case data frames? Any good articles / books / videos / code based that you would recommend to learn more about best practices?"
1068,Critique/help with the MLOps plan for a small DS team,10,g8ojeg,datascience,11,"I work for a small (~4 person) data science team within a much larger organization. The team is responsible for making two machine learning models, creating a single set of very important predicted values, and creating reporting and data validation tools relevant to those predicted values. I came on board about 4 months ago with experience in data science, systems administration, and devops. I have a strong linux background and plenty of experience with Docker and Kubernetes. 

I've been asked to improve the existing modeling pipeline. I've come up with a plan that I think is feasible given the organization's goals and (considerable) constraints, but I'm hoping to get feedback on potential pitfalls or things to add from people with more ML/dev ops experience than myself. I also thought it might be fun for this sub to think through what the ideal toolchain might be given a pretty serious set of constraints.

## Goals

- Make our pipeline more robust. No more undetected data issues or breaking commits. Automatic unit and integration tests on all commits/merge requests.
- Improve pipeline transparency and reporting. Make summary and performance statistics about each model more easily available.
- Make testing and comparing new models significantly easier. More clearly tie new model results/objects to the code that produced them.
- Make the whole pipeline run continuously and automatically (given new data or other triggers).

## Constraints

- No cloud infrastructure. Everything has to be on-prem.
- Absolutely no additional money. Zero.
- Need to keep the developer toolchain as light as possible. It has to be usable by a team with limited devops/linux experience.
- Infrastructure can be (and is) linux + Docker based, but it has to be simple enough that if I die it's easy to understand and maintain for someone with a moderate devops background. For the same reason, all infrastructure setup has to be infrastructure as code.
- Any rebuild has to be done within 6 months of one person's full time work. This includes all infrastructure setup, code refactoring, CI/CD setup, and new code.
- The pipeline/modeling itself has to be written in R.

## Tools Available

- Hardware is limited to 2 beefy SQL servers, 2 beefy Ubuntu VMs, and ~6 beefy Windows workstations. 
- We recently upgraded to GitLab Silver for the whole organization and have all the features that go along with it.

## Current Setup

This is a relatively new team that had to get something up and running quickly, so they haven't yet had the time or resources to setup a mature ML pipeline or incorporate many devops best practices. However, they're committed to improving things and making the best system possible, hence why they asked for this plan. The current pipeline is:

1. **Data extraction/processing.** Data is stored entirely in SQL and feature engineering/data extraction is done via SQL views. The view definitions are stored in GitLab. There is one SQL server that is used for both reporting and modeling. Data extraction takes a *very* long time.

2. **Modeling.** The entire pipeline is written in R and is stored in a single, large GitLab repo. Scripts are manually triggered sequentially to run the actual pipeline and modeling. Data ingest/validation, modeling, model validation, and reporting are all roughly part of the same repo. This repo has no unit testing or integration testing.

3. **Reporting.** Reporting is done via R Markdown and a set of Shiny apps that exist separately from the main modeling repo. These reporting applications pull from the same SQL server as the main modeling scripts and report on the predicted values created in the modeling step. Model performance metrics are not available to the reporting apps.

Other notes:

- Intermediate data and model objects are not saved. The model specification and performance statistics of the best performing model are saved to an excel sheet. The predicted values produced by this model are saved back to SQL.

- Testing new models and/or functional forms is done manually by editing the main repo's R code. Model outputs are not tied to specific commits or branches.

## Planned Improvements

Given my constraints, I'd like to make the following improvements:

- Disaggregate the steps of the pipeline into discrete repositories/tasks that can be individually run, tested, and worked on. Add unit testing to each of these repos that runs automatically (via GitLab CI/CD). 
- Create an R package or packages that contains widely used functions and small datasets. Also add unit testing to these repos.
- Create a separate SQL server that mirrors the original server and is used exclusively for reporting.
- Use [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) (running in Docker on a VM) to store the intermediate data produced by each step in the pipeline as well the final model objects. This is to prevent people from needing to constantly re-run the same data ingest scripts.
- Use DVC to define clear DAGs that automate the process of running the pipeline and collecting metrics on the results. Upload model metrics to a new table in SQL.
- Again use DVC to tie model output and data to specific commits and branches.
- Using the model summary metrics in both DVC and SQL, add some sort of reporting dashboard (Tableau, Shiny) that facilitates easy comparison of different models.

Those are my immediate thoughts for improvements, but I'm curious to get this sub's take as well. Additionally, I'd love to find an ML ops mentor if someone out there is willing to teach/talk.

**TL;DR:** You have 2 SQL servers, 2 VMs, a GitLab subscription, 0 money, and 1 person with linux experience. What's the most robust/transparent machine learning pipeline you can make?"

1071,How do I get out of data science?,324,g8250o,datascience,130,"Edit: Thanks for all the help and good ideas. I think I really just need more variety and (substantial) human interaction in my work. A couple mentioned they didn't have trouble going into systems engineers from data science, so I'll look into that. I work for a defense contractor that really focuses on IT implementations, and I think I want to get more into working with tangible products. So I don't know if I can quite do what I want without making a lateral move. I live right down the road from Raytheon and the ULA, so after all this blows over, I think I'll send my resume out. I'll also talk to my boss and see if I can shadow our company's product managers for a little while. I don't know a ton about that world but it does seem interesting. Thanks a ton! 

I've worked as a data scientist for a couple years now, and I'm really unhappy. I've worked at a start up and a large company. I'm well compensated but I've really grown to hate my career.

I'm tired of spending my days staring a computer. I'm tired of working for ""AI experts"" who couldn't import a Python module if their lives depended it. I'm tired of having to solve everyone's data problems and having my projects drag out for months. 

I've considered systems engineering and project management, but I don't feel like I have enough experience for that. 

What else can I do? I don't really want to go back to school because I hated college and honestly didn't do very well. Has anyone else made a transition out of data science?"

1074,Should Students Put DS/ML Projects That Involve Games On Their Resume? Will They Be Taken Seriously?,94,g7u81k,datascience,39,"Hey r/datascience! I run a youtube channel applying machine learning concepts to online games like Runescape and Neopets. I’ve had a few students reach out to me wishing they’d have the time of day to work on projects like these but they are worried that the projects will not be taken as seriously as other projects would. It’s especially worrying during this pandemic with jobs being scarce and their future being uncertain which I can definitely empathize with.

That said, I wanted to ask professionals/students alike in this community a couple questions regarding projects that involve games:

1. In the context of hiring, are DS/ML projects that involve games as valid as projects that don’t involve games?
2. For side projects in general, how long would a typically good project take? Does the time frame really matter?
3. What do recruiters/managers look for to measure good understanding in these DS/ML projects?
4. If you’re a student, what would be your concerns with projects like these? 

I personally think that properly applying DS/ML principles in an end-to-end project would be a valid talking point in any context. However, I’m a little biased so I definitely wanted to see what people thought. Please let me know and thank you for your time!"

1083,Established Team or Wild West?,9,g5pu5w,datascience,15,"I have recently accepted an offer but current employer expressed interest to retain. Just want to pick some brains to see how people choose between a mature team and a brand new team.

First of all both are large companies that are not directly impacted by the disease.

My current team is very resourceful. I work with a group of PhD and masters, who are all extremely bright and have a lot I can learn from. I picked up a ton of knowledge just from being exposed to their work. 

The new offer I received is for a brand new ""data analytics"" team. There are a lot of potential for legitimate data science projects but the team is about .5 - 1 year away from having the right infrastructure (proper data warehouse, tooling, and culture).  Once that's fulfilled, the bulk of work will be in BI, with areas enhanced by machine learning.

&#x200B;

I guess I've been the dumbest person on the team for a while and it's time to branch out and try things on my own? With my current team, I don't get R&D project and to be honest, I constantly feel the problems we're solving (deep learning, NLP) are too difficult for me. A big part of my work is in deploying and executing models, so they are software engineering-heavy in nature as oppose to business-related (which I prefer more).

With the new team, I have more say on directions and the type of projects the team should be doing. There will be more chances of identifying business opportunities and implementing a solution. The work seems to be more inclined to using traditional ML methods, which I'm more familiar with, but I'm certain I'll be fighting politics, budget, and maybe even struggling to come up with impactful ML solutions.

I think a place I could improve is how my projects are structured, where my input and output data is stored, readability, things like that. I thought maybe to get the book Reafactoring by Fowler, does anyone have any opinions on that?

Is there any other good resources people can recommend? I'm also generally interested in other thing I can do to improve my code. What are things you think people could generally improve upon? Ideally, I would like to be able to produce readable code that is structured in a sensible way, that won't annoy other people if they have to use it.

1085,Is this r/datascience or r/machinelearning,112,g56zs3,datascience,85,
1086,Does my current salary seem appropriate for my location & experience?,0,g54gnx,datascience,31,"I'm a Data Scientist in San Francisco, with a base salary of 150k. My company is a private mid-sized tech company, but not that well-known, so my equity doesn't seem to matter in counting.

For some context, I have under 2 years of experience working as a Data Scientist. I have a Masters and Bachelor's degree in pretty well-known schools, but these degrees aren't actually in data science or software engineering. I came into the workforce basically straight out of Master's. I would say I'm pretty proficient in ML, SQL, and Python, but my understanding of model deployment and cloud architecture is weak since I don't have an engineering degree. My strength is in analytics, business insights, and communication with external stakeholders (somewhat like sales).  

My day to day responsibilities runs wide, since it's not a big company. It's everything from data analysis, model training, A/B testing, dashboarding, etc.

Based on the above information, I'm wondering if my current base salary sounds appropriate to what what I am performing and where I'm located? Someone asked this question in cscareers subreddit, and I wanted to ask the same thing.

The reason I ask is due to what my peers seem to be making around the area. Buddies of mine from FANG are pretty vocal about making 250k straight out of college (of course, a lot of that comes from equity, but does it really matter?). I'm pretty content with my current company (our work hours are really good, like 9-5 without much stress).

Assuming I get there, I am wondering what the job market will be like. I'm 45 now. Wherever I end up, should I be worried about looking for jobs as I get older? 

I never had to worry about finding jobs before. I have strong technical experience but only academic modeling experience. Now I'm wondering how easy that will be, due to my age. 

Maybe I need to start my own business so I don't have to do interviews anymore."
1088,Tell me why I should learn SQL (a little bit of a rant),0,g4w6ax,datascience,45,"TLDR is at the bottom,

Some background first, I've been working for almost two years as a Junior Data Scientist at a small IoT startup in Massachusetts doing mostly big data analysis with Apache Spark, and ML research/deployment with Amazon SageMaker. With the pandemic going on, and the market the way it is, not many investors are looking to fund new rounds right now, so things are getting pretty tight. Fortunately for me, the executive team is very transparent and let me know it might be time to start looking for something more stable for the time being.

Since then I've had more than a few technical interviews, and a lot of them haven't gone very well, mainly because my SQL skills are extremely basic at best. This isn't a problem at my current company because I use Apache PySpark for everything, I run it on an EMR cluster and it's usually faster than traditional SQL. I usually try to explain Spark to potential employers when they ask me about my SQL skills, but their response is usually like ""ok great, now solve this complex SQL problem anyway"".

In my opinion, PySpark is a faster alternative to raw SQL. I feel a bit frustrated because I feel like employers don't care or believe that I'm just as effective as someone with strong SQL skills.

TLDR:

Why should I learn what in my opinion is a slower alternative (SQL) to a tool I am already skilled with (PySpark)?

Am I wrong to believe I'm as effective as someone who is strong with SQL?

Why do employers insist that I must be skilled with SQL to be a good Data Scientist, even if I explain Apache Spark to them?

# Common Responses:

Really all the responses are in one of three bins

1. You need to learn SQL so you can (\*insert thing you use SQL to do\*)

My response is that I don't, I can use Spark to do almost any SQL task.

2. Just learn SQL it's easy

Yeah, It looks like I'm going to need to do this, but it doesn't really answer my question.

3. People working on a team should all use the same technology for peer review, and so others can pick up where one left off if they leave, plus other reasons. (\*insert harsh sarcasm implying I want everyont on a potential team to switch from SQL to Spark\*)

I come from a collaborative team of scientists who use a variety of tech, from my perspective it seemed reasonable to have a team where not everyone uses the same technology. I guess this is more of a unique case than I was aware of and most companies only hire people who can use the same tech as the team they would be working on. This makes sense to me, I just didn't think it was as obvious/required as others are suggessting.

My only opportunity right now is a job to where a recruiter reached out to me on linkedin. Any advice?

EDIT: I just graduated and I do have a data science internship under my belt with a large healthcare system that included typical data cleaning in sql and machine learning in R. The degree was basically a traditional stat major with 4 elective slots swapped for intro level bio classes. I'm fluent in R and sql too

1098,Mathematical Proof That No Decision-making Algorithm Can Be Completely Fair,10,g2f68k,datascience,8,"I few months ago, when listening to a data science podcast, I came across a notion that there have been papers published demonstrating a mathematical paradox related to algorithmic fairness. The gist was that there a three characteristics that we would ideally like a decision-making algorithm to embody, yet it can be proven mathematically that these can't be simultaneously satisfied—there is always a trade-off. I believe that two of these characteristics were false-positive and false-negative rate but I'm not even sure of that. Is there anyone familiar with this topic that could point me towards the paper? I've lost the original podcast episode and Googling has got me nowhere."
1099,FAANG Data Scientist -> Software Engineer?,5,g23gw3,datascience,21,"I'm currently a data scientist at a big tech company, about 2 years in after a career change in my mid 20s. My current job is about as close to my dream job as it gets. I work on interesting problems and I genuinely enjoy the work. I'm concerned about my career path and am considering switching to software engineer for a few reasons:

1. I only have a bachelor's degree. It's a **solid** bachelors degree (computer science and stats from an ivy), but a bachelor nonetheless. Literally every data science manager i can think of has at least a master's. I'm confident that I *could* make progress at my current company, but at places like google they won't even hire a data scientist without a masters. I'm paying down lots of student debt right now and couldn't dream of going another 100k in the hole. From what I can tell, software engineering doesn't have this hard education cutoff.
2. I write next to no production code. I crank out analyses using jupyter notebooks and SQL like my hair is on fire, but only my final recommendations are seen. Combining this with a recent influx of MBAs into the field, I worry that I'm on track to a not-so-technical career path. Like consultant or something. Not necessarily bad, but I fell in love with writing code before I was a data scientist.
3. The big advances in analytics seem to be coming from building platforms, services, etc. I think I'm naturally inclined to build things and I enjoy this kind of work. Down the road, the combination of these two kinds of data science (business-focus and engineering-focused ) would give me a huge leg up.

Should I make the jump? I'm in my early 30s and I'm just not jazzed about dropping a mortgage down payment for another degree just for the ability to advance. I'd rather leverage what I've learned as a data scientist as a leg up on a career path that doesn't have the same barrier to entry.

Thanks in advance!"
1100,100-days Data Science Challenge!,478,g20x47,datascience,67,"One month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fisj71/from_economics_to_data_science/) about starting my curriculum for DS/ML and got lots of great advice, suggestions, and feedback. Through this month I have not skipped a single day and I plan to continue my streak for 100 days. Also, I made some changes in my ""curriculum"" and wanted to provide some updates and feedback on my experience. There's tons of information and resources out there and it's really easy to get overwhelmed (Which I did before I came up with this plan), so maybe this can help others to organize better and get started.

&#x200B;

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D"
1101,How to get real meaning from clustering analysis?,14,g1yrv7,datascience,32,"Hi folks,

I've been looking at Clustering with Kmeans in SciKit Learn. I've produced a workbook and got everything to work with a pretty graph and decent metrics. If anyone wants the detail, code is at [https://github.com/michaelf736/Unsupervised-learning-with-Kmeans](https://github.com/michaelf736/Unsupervised-learning-with-Kmeans) 

My question is, how do I interpret this in the real world? My boss is going to say, 'great but what does that tell me about how I should run the business?' and to be honest, I haven't got a clue.

My dataset has 8 features, which I reduced to 3D in order to make the analysis work. However, that leaves me with a 3D scatter plot that looks nice but I can't relate it back to the 8 features I started with.

Can anyone help me with this or point me in the right direction please?

1102,Is BERT too general for an NLP project with a very limited corpus with very specific contexts?,62,g1suaz,datascience,22,"I am working as a Machine Learning dev on an NLP project in the Aerospace industry. To give professional context, prior to this most of my ML work so far has been with structured numerical, ordinal, or categorical data from 3D simulations & video games and NLP is somewhat new to me. 

Specifically the goal is the following

1. Users take a picture of standardized work specifications with a custom app on their phones and then an OCR technology recognizes the text in the picture. (The OCR tech is already working)
2. A custom NLP tech classifies the text in the picture into specific classes and then populates a form in the app with the recognized text.

I am working on the NLP side and trying to decide which word embedding to use. The corpus for this project have meanings that are very specific to an Aerospace context (for example ""ceiling"" would relate to almost exclusively to the maximum altitude of an aircraft and NOT walls/floor/etc. ) and the amount of unique words on the work orders is likely no more than 2500-4000.

BERT's bidirectional approach seems like it would lead in general to accurate understanding of context, but I'm wondering if the pre-trained BERT models would be far too general an application like this where the context is ultra-specific.

My questions specifically are

1. Would a pre-trained BERT model be likely to overgeneralize here? 
2. Would training a BERT model from scratch (likely to do NER) be overkill? Would a simpler model be better here?"

# Intuition

Once upon a time, there was a task given (this was a decade back when excel & vlookup were the 2 of 3 famous terms in the world of analytics).  
As the story goes… this was for a retail industry, we did some analytics around the products that customers are purchasing. 1. What are the products they are looking at & searching? 2. What are the commonalities, pattern, segmentation etc etc.  
End of the day, we had to analyse hundreds of thousands of transactions; thousands of people, their purchase and invoices;

We found an interesting pattern happening very often. When people shop in the evening between 6 and 9. **Customers who buy diapers also buy beer**.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syeee0ym4rs41.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=80befea480ce0ec2391ebfdbed336a776433e30b

But, this insight was like out of the blue completely as these 2 products are completely not connected.  
***Why would somebody buy beer when they’re buying diapers or why buy diapers when they’re buying beer!!!***  
So that was the fact we came across in the data and the explanations as fact. **One of the plausible explanations we gave;** In the evenings, when the husband gets home and when they take care of their baby; they sometimes find that they run out of diapers and who has to go pick up the diapers.. well, the husband. The wife sends husband to go pick up the diapers and **while he is picking up the diapers because its already after work hours, he also picks up some beer. Right.**

And this plausible explanation might be logical or not be. This is something you can’t really think of it just by yourself but that comes from the data.

As I’ve highlighted this in my previous [***post***](https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7), based on certain insights derived from data; a supermarket or retail industry can decide how to arrange products in your shelf **whether you run an e-commerce store to rank & show your products in your virtual shelf or a superstore to put these 2 products to entice people while shopping.**

So there is a lot of interesting marketing tactics that are using based on this data. But the question is; how do you get to this data?

>*You may read :*[*A beginner’s guide to understanding recommendation system*](https://medium.com/@karthik.thandapani/a-beginners-guide-to-understanding-recommendation-system-f6c0054dfb7c?source=friends_link&sk=70c9b7177a1e731b3c742aca26ae22e7)

**And one of the ways to get to it is leveraging analytics use apriori algorithm.**

# Problem Statement

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on one’s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:  
*Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.*  
*Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.*  
*Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.*  
*X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.*

Association rules are “if-then rules” with two measures which quantify the support and confidence of the rule for a given data set. Having their origin in market basket analysis, association rules are now one of the most popular tools in data mining. This popularity is to a large part due to the availability of efficient algorithms. The first and arguably most influential algorithm for efficient association rule discovery is Apriori.

**Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.**  
Folks from healthcare industry, are you reading this ?

# Definition

Association rules analysis is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. There are three common ways to measure association.

1. **Support:**  
This says how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

2. **2. Confidence:**  
This will highlight how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In diagram below, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.

&#x200B;

**3. Lift:**  
Table below how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In diagram below, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought.

&#x200B;

**Association Rule Mining**  
Now that we understand how to quantify the importance of association of products within an itemset, the next step is to generate rules from the entire list of items and identify the most important ones. This is not as simple as it might sound. Supermarkets will have hundred of thousands of different products in store. After some simple calculations, it can be shown that just 10 products will lead to 57000 rules!! And this number increases exponentially with the increase in number of items.  
Finding lift values for each of these will get computationally very very expensive. How to deal with this problem? How to come up with a set of most important association rules to be considered? Apriori algorithm comes to our rescue for this.

**Lets build an efficient recommendation system in R studio**

1. Load data
2. Install apriori
3. Data pre-processing | Decode sparse matrix | Plot
4. Train & Test
5. Visualize

In this example, we will work on a sample dataset from a grocery store, understand the business problem, and ways to optimize the sales using apriori algorithm leveraging machine learning.

1109,Uncomfortable as data scientist: looking for guidance,95,g0is1r,datascience,38,"This may not be a super structured post, but I just want to get something off my chest: I'm 24 years old, and around 6 months ago I joined as a data scientist at a consulting firm (for people who care, MBB) and I am extremely uncomfortable in my position. I simply feel like I don't know enough, and that I never will.. At the same time, I find the work very rewarding and technically interesting, and I definitely want to stay in the field. This leads to the realization that if I am to stay in the field, I should find ways to deal with this discomfort. Maybe you guys can help me..

I have a background in aerospace engineering, and got into the field by basically doing self study (understanding the math behind most basic algorithms, applying them to Kaggle problems, and getting as good as possible in Python). I interned as a data scientist where I basically did nothing academic (sort of a real-life Kaggle competition to be honest), and through some luck ended up in the position I am in now.

Fueled by imposter syndrome, I tend to spend most of my free time (weekends mainly) doing self study and trying to learn more. I am not doing this because I **have** to, I am genuinely interested in the field. However, it feels like there is so much to learn and it is starting to get to me.

To give some context, I have never done anything related to neural networks. I kind of know how it works on a high level and I know what backpropagation is and the math behind it, but I have never actually coded up any sort of deep learning model. I am definitely not comfortable in using it in my daily work.

I also don't know anything about Bayesian statistics. I have spent the last week or so going through numerous sources and am now comfortable with the idea of priors, likelihood functions, how to update the posterior, and various ways of finding the posterior (grid approximation/quadrature/MCMC). But again, I have never actually used it so I don't feel like I actually am capable of using it in my day-to-day work.

Just today I learned about the existence of Generalized Linear Models, and it is as if suddenly I am confronted with yet another beast which I had no idea existed. But guess what: if I truly want to be a good at what I do and be a master in my field, I have to learn this as well. And at this point, I don't even really know what it means.

I guess my general question is: how do you guys deal with this situation? There are seemingly infinite things to learn about, and then each of those things can be learned to an arbitrary level of detail. How do you pick what to learn/focus on, and how do you decide that ""enough is enough?"".

Also, how do you decide if something you learned off-the-job is useful in your daily work? Having conceptual understanding is one thing, but actually applying it requires quite a leap of faith in knowing what you know."

Beyond very elementary data visualization during EDA stages that serves just to paint a clearer picture in my mind of what a physical representation of my data might look like, I'm pretty stumped as to what more matplotlib offers. Does it really bring something to the table that not only makes it worth the trouble of trying to learn it properly despite its unintuitive rules, but also makes it superior to other options that are plain easier and less time consuming?

I'm not dense enough to think that people who take the time to get extremely good at it don't have their reasons - I'm just really eager to learn what those are. Just came out of a stackoverflow exchange thinking ""how on EARTH could that dude have known precisely that"", so now left curious as to what the motivating factor is for matplotlib virtuosos."

Here's the list without all the intro BS. Please do comment if you have some items to add! :

# Chapter 1 : General Structure

* Is there an established map of the database?
* Is it visible to all users?
* Is there a public strategy of how it is tested for truth?
* Are there known party(ies) responsible for updating it when there are structural changes?
* How often is it updated?
* When is the next scheduled update?
* Is there a change log to track prior changes?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with questions?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with general conversational topics?
* The user list from a DBA is great for this.
* Consider having a monthly meeting and yearly summit per database. Remember, this is YOUR responsibility. Not the owner of the database.
* If the source of data is an application or form, is there a map from every entry field to the corresponding field in the database?
* Capacity / Uptime
* How concerned should you be with locking up the database with poorly written queries?
* Who do you go to when it is dead?
* Is the data backed up / archived anywhere?
* For how long?
* Do you remove old values from the production database after archiving?
* Are queries logged?
* How often is the database refreshed, if it is part of an ETL?
* Automatically check, at the appropriate time, if it has been updated. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably not updated.
* What is the official way to request access to the database?
* Is there a time-out process of old user ID’s?
* Have a plan in place for when an automated procedure’s stored credentials are suddenly invalid.

**Tables**

* Is there any rhyme or reason to the naming of tables?
* If there are very similar tables (ie. CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER\_NEW, CUSTOMER\_NEW\_NEW), do the alternates need to exist?
* Is this table “one row that is constantly kept updated” or “one row for each time the data changes”?

**Joins**

* Should there be at least one “Child” for every “Parent”?
* Is there a maximum expected “Children” for every “Parent”?
* Should there be “Children” who don’t have “Parents”?
* Is every table relatable to every other table?
* On joining fields
* Do the field types match, or do you need to do a conversion?
* Queries / Processes
* Is the query properly notated?
* With the code removed, the notes should be copy and paste-able to a non-technical business partner.
* The notes should represent reality. Please.
* Is it possible to do an “anti-query”?
* Reverse your filters, but mirror your production process. In high value pipelines, this can be a huge preventative measure for errors, and an easy way to provide “free” extra value.
* Is it possible to do the query by hand on a small subset of records?
* If so, do this periodically. Seriously. I know you got into this line of business to not do this stuff manually, but doing this periodically can help verify all systems are working properly.
* Is the process entirely automated?
* If not, don’t launch.
* This includes any of the tests below that say “periodically”, if possible.
* Is it possible to store the results of every query, along with a timestamp of run (especially as part of an ETL process?)
* Are you choosing a “whitelist” approach, or a “blacklist” approach?
* If there are changes after launch — will you be applying those changes to previous projects, or leaving them in place with old (and potentially inaccurate) data?

# Chapter 2 : Data Types

**All / General**

* Are null values allowed?
* Are the fields expected to change over time? If the answer is “no”, take hashes of lines at the time of development and test periodically to see if they change. If the answer is “yes”, take extracts with timestamps in the name and only use those (instead of production) for reproducibility.
* Expert level — Create a X / Y grid of every field against every other field. Have all parties involved in development (especially the humans that are the source of the data) write assumptions and rules that come up in each cell (if this field is “beer” this other field should be “$5.99”) Document all of these. If something looks wrong and the customer says “that’s ok”, DOCUMENT THIS. With audio evidence if possible. Video isn’t bad either.

**General Text (Free entry)**

* If there is a default size, why is the default size set to the size it is?
* Is the field having an identity crisis — does it only contain integers, dates, locations, etc.? If so — should it be converted to the correct type? What do you do with those that can’t be converted?
* Does the text contain invisible characters that will cause it to print strangely (line-break)?
* Does the text contain special (or international) characters? Should it? If you are planning on exporting to .csv downstream, are you removing commas upstream (or tabs, or pipes, etc.).
* Is there a list of “stop words” that should be applied? Especially inappropriate words. Don’t let an f-bomb get into a shareholder report.

**Categorical Text (Unique list of values)**

* Store the unique values at the time you are developing, and the counts of each value. Periodically test for new/missing values. Have a plan in place for when this inevitably happens.
* Periodically test for wild changes in distribution. Communicate these to anyone who will listen. This will make you a hero. Provide this list to stakeholders during development. This is always interesting, because often it is vastly different than their estimate.
* If there are multiple categorical fields, is there an hierarchy that is documented and should be followed (if veh\_type is “car”, then veh\_brand can only be “audi”, “ford”, “toyota” etc.). Have a plan in place for when this inevitably breaks.
* Is the field indexed for fast grouping?
* If the values are text numbers (one, two, three) — should they be converted to integers (1, 2, 3)?

**Boolean (True/False)**

* If these represent a “switch” in the process, should the downstream impact also be represented in data? (if override\_price=0 then discount\_price should never be null)
* Store the distribution at the time of developing, and periodically test for changes. Communicate these to anyone who will listen.
* Does True or False have a different name to you customers? IE, 0 = No Sale, 1 = Sale.
* What should you do with nulls, if there are any?

**ID (Keys, AutoNum)**

* Is the ID an AutoNum? If so, are there missing values?
* Is the ID a complex key? Do characters in the complex key relate to the data in any way? Periodically test that this remains true.
* Are duplicates allowed?
* Are you operating under the assumption that the ID for any given record will never change (maintaining an extract or join to a private table)? Have a plan in place for when they inevitably do.
* If you remove the ID from the equation, are there any two completely identical rows?

**General Number/Integer**

* Does null = 0?
* Are negative values expected?
* Are decimals expected? If not, is there rounding occurring upstream? What are the rounding rules?
* Is there a maximum/minimum expected value? Record the minimum and maximum value at the time of development. Periodically test to see if this record has been broken.
* Is there an expected distribution? Periodically test to see if this has changed.
* Is the number secretly categorical (only certain allowed values)?
* Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250…)?
* Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?
* Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I’m looking at you, Smallint)?
* Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price\*tax=total)?
* Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?

**Currency**

* Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?
* If the record also has a “country” — does the currency match the country?
* Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.
* Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.
* Does null = 0?
* Does the value represent a “current” value, or a “point in time” value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?
* Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?

**General Contact Information**

* Is there a schedule for updating contact information?
* When was the information last updated?
* When was the information last successfully used?
* If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.
* Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?
* Does any contact information match your own company/office information?
* Does any customer’s information match that of a current or former employee?
* Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!

**Phone Numbers**

* Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?
* Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.
* Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?
* Is there an assumed area code?
* Is the area code a toll free area code?
* Is the area code a legitimate area code?
* Is the phone number stored as text?
* Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?
* Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?
* Are you removing “bogus” phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).
* If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?

**Mailing Address**

* Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?
* Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?
* If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?
* Is the Postal Code -> State/Region -> Country strictly enforced?
* Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?
* Is there an additional “APT” or “PO BOX” field? Should you be aware of this?
* If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?

**Sensitive PII**

* Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?
* Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?

**Financial Information**

* God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.
* Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?
* See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.

**Date / Time**

* Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?
* Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?
* Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.
* Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.
* Are there records outside business hours?
* Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?
* Are there any dates that are in the future?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?
* When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently — it’s valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.
* If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).
* Does everyone know what “biweekly” means?
* Does everyone know what “midnight” means?
* Is there a business preferred date format?
* For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.
* Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?

The end! Thanks for reading through, and contributing more ideas. I will try to keep this list updated."

1120,What is actually done with the Data I collect?,24,fyr7kk,datascience,3,"I'm so sorry if this isn't actually allowed here, as I myself am not a data scientist in any capacity. My job however does deal with data, and I'm curious about it. Tl;dr why do companies want certain data and what do they do with it? 

My company provides retailers with pricing data collected by employees in the field. I am one of those Field Data Collectors. Basically I'm assigned several jobs at different stores throughout the week. Some jobs repeat weekly, or monthly, or quarterly. Some jobs require the collecting of certain items on a list, some requiring scanning every item in a category and collecting those prices. 

An example: every week Bullseye wants to know how Walcarts prices a specific 500 items at 20 different stores in the area. I'm assigned 3 stores, go into each of those stores and find the items, scan them, and input the prices. If that store does not carry the exact item I indicate it. Different DCs are assigned the different locations.

I don't even know what happens in my own company after I upload my job to submit the data i've collected, let alone what the retailer does with the data they're given. 

I'm just curious, why do these major retailers (and even some minor more local/ region specific retailers) contract with our company to get this data? What do they use it for? The company website sells itself as ""Our clients benefit from omni-channel, normalized, and actionable Pricing Intelligence at massive scale to inform on-target pricing strategy and maximize business impact."" What does that even mean? 

Another question I have, who benefits most from this data? Is it only the corporations, or is there any benefit to the consumer as well? 

Also, when Bullseye wants pricing from Walcarts, Walcarts sends us to a Rokger banner, and Rokger finally asks for Bullseye data, does that really end up benefiting anybody? They're all getting data from eachother in a circular manner. 

I'll delete this post if it's not welcome here, I didn't know where else to post."
1121,How to stay organized when writing code,216,fyk6y8,datascience,96,"I'm using R to do an analysis of my dataset, and there's a lot of EDA and filtering in my code as I compare results of different segments.  Is there an easier way or best practice that has worked for you in terms of staying organized and making sure that as you make changes to our code and revert back, you're not forgetting or missing anything?

&#x200B;

For example:

I have a 300 line code that generates some results and graphics of an overall performance.  If my boss asks me to slice my data and look at the same results and graphics at a different segment, I need to go back to line 79 to change my filter,  maybe line 120 to adjust my dataframe, etc etc to get the code working.  Lots of things can go wrong here, especially when I revert back to the original and I may forget about line 120, something like that, or if I have to do multiple segments, I dont have to scroll up and down so many times

An example I can think of off the top of my head would be something like “Plotluck”. It’s not your typical package that most people know about, and it seems to be pretty cool from a higher glance at it.

1124,Internship got rescinded. What to do?,163,fy52zf,datascience,77,"Hello Everybody,

Just a little background: I am a [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) in Data Science student graduating in December 2020.

I had a Data Analytics internship lined up for summer with a company I really liked but they recently rescinded their internship program due to COVID-19. I know internships are vital towards landing permanent positions.  Since, it is fairly late to apply for other internships and remote options are heavily applied for leading to low likelihood of securing one, I am worried about the whole situation.

So my question to current Data Scientists is how important is an internship in securing a permanent job? Are there any alternatives to that?

Also, what should I do over the summer that would be helpful towards advancing my career in Data Science?

Thank you for your time."
1125,How do you know if your dataset has been exhausted,111,fxvb1b,datascience,51,"You're given a task from a client. You're given the data. You've gotten to understand the data. 

It's sparse, very sparse, imbalanced also. All your tricks do not seem to work. 

Yet there's still this hunch, and a big chunk of dissatisfaction, with failing to prove the underlying relationship you set out to do. 

You can always reparameterize; Maybe the response should be encoded in a different fashion, what about additional feature engineering, basis functions, priors, enriching the data.

The question is, **when do you stop**? When do you accept the solution you're looking for, does not exist in this haystack. Accept the defeat."
1126,Turned down Uber's Data Scientist final job interview...did I make a mistake?,5,fxtwal,datascience,17,"Data Scientist in Silicon Valley here. Started applying for jobs 2 months ago to transition to a new company before the pandemic hit. I interviewed with multiple companies and reached the final interview portion for Uber before bailing on it (as well as all other companies in my pipeline). I increasingly felt that these service app companies were especially volatile and vulnerable right now, if you see what's going on with their stocks, their non-existent customer base, and mass layoffs (ex: Thumbtack).

But did I make a mistake in my assessment? I don't know if I overly freaked out and turned down what would likely have become a job offer. My company pays me well, and since I'm in the online streaming business it feels a lot more secure. But my total comp isn't as great as what Uber/Lyft offers in the Bay Area (200k+) and switching to these companies could mean almost 30%+ lift in my total comp.

1130,Books on Data Science/Machine Learning impact,20,fx3xyz,datascience,6,"I am a data scientist/ML engineer trying to get to know different  angles for looking at my profession, especially how it may affect people  with other background.

In the last years I read some books, but probably they're biased  (being written by people who did it professionally, at least at some  point)

* *Master Algorithm* by Domingos (good book, but it's sort of popular science on ML and the social aspect part is very weak IMO, because it is full of hype and reads more like a sales pitch than result of some analysis)
* *Weapons of Math Destruction* by O'Neill - it touches some relevant points. I'm not sure about the validity given O'Neill's track record though - she once lamented how no one does research on AI fairness (this was in a newspaper article, it was not long ago, when there were established programs and research groups on that). Also book is very political and might sometimes be annoying if you don't exactly lean left
* *Outnumbered* by David Sumpter - this is by far the best book I've read, it's well balanced, like for example the author mentions different metrics that were used to assume whether algorithms made racist predictions or not. Also he doesn't push any ML hype, and actually finds there is no proof for some results that got huge media coverage.
* *Architects of Intelligence* \- it's a set of interviews with ML people. What is great about it is that you can see that there is no consensus on the future of the field, and that people who actually have impact have divergent opinions on some topics (like for example on regulation)
* *AI Superpowers* by Kai-Fu Lee - a book by author who was involved with many facets of ML - research, business side (as head of Google China) and venture capital. This one is especially interesting since aside from AI it describes digitalization in China. One of maiin theses is that the US leads in research, but implementation side is tilted towards China because of different business culture (author says that in China companies are not so innovative, as everyone copies from one another another, but that makes its environment more competitive since it doesn't have so strong founder effect where first company to come up with an idea dominates its niche).

I'm looking for books preferably written by specialists (as opposed to journalists), also maybe if this becomes a big list someone will find it helpful.

Thanks for suggestions."

I received my Bachelors in Statistical Science (combo of math, stats, coding) in  Jun 2019 and I have been working as a full time data scientist since I graduated. My manager said that the company  would pay for any bootcamps I want to attend.

A coworker is taking this bootcamp [https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-remote-online), but it seems somewhat introductory?

I am comfortable working with Python, R, SQL. I think I'm a pretty good coder, but I would like to learn more and get better. I really enjoy coding!  I know enough Javascript and HTML to do my job (interactive dashboards using D3js). I'm familiar with ML and have done projects, but I'm not super comfortable. Also, I learned all the math and stats in college, but I haven't done much data analysis in the real world yet so it would be nice to practice those skills. Also never learned any big data stuff, so maybe it's time to learn Hadoop? Not sure.

Has anyone done any bootcamps that they can recommend that are for fine tuning these data science skills that you already have and learning more complex things?

These things are keeping you away from getting things done. Now you have enough free time to work on that project, to widen your in Data Science, to implement this new tool at your job, to do that course or to become an expert in your field. Here are 3 quick tips that will increase your focus and will make you avoid distractions:

- Set up a clean environment. Have your desk clear. If possible be alone in the room, where no one in your family will be passing by. Set boundaries with them, telling them that you will be working so please no interruptions if it is not needed. 

- Follow your normal routine at your job. Take breaks, do the pauses you normally do and when finishing your job totally disconnect from work. Avoid reading and responding to emails in the evening.  

- Set clear goals. The uncertainty makes us work with no direction. Create specific and objective goals, give them a time frame and start each day with the task which needs a bigger effort from you.

I've been using matplotlib fairly extensively for more than a year (previously used ggplot) yet I still don't understand it. I mean I've generated a bunch of common templates that I reuse, but every time I need something different, I have to google it because I have absolutely no idea how to do it. It's just not intuitive to me for some reason. Having two APIs makes things even more confusing, and I just can't remember which method works with which API (e.g. to turn off axis labels).

What I've been trying so far:

- reading stackoverflow answers
- reading references
- practicing

Despite all this I'm still terrible with matplotlib. I'm trying to understand why, what I need to be doing differently...

1142,Dealing with Unrealistic Expectations as Employee #2,16,fvyrky,datascience,16,"Wondering if anyone can help me out in my current situation

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr** the company that just hired me is not ready for data scientists. I’m being asked to do things that are very far from my expertise, but I also have no other job prospects. I also really like the field the app is in, have a ton of time while under quarantine, and the motivation to try and make as much of this work as possible. Any help is appreciated.

\----

I’m a data science bootcamp graduate (I know, I know. I apologize for existing.) and not surprisingly have been struggling to find my entry into the field, but I was getting interviews, particularly in my area/domain of interest. Then the virus hit the US and all my prospects shriveled, except for one. It’s a startup in my domain, an app where users would make decisions regarding a particular “score”.

&#x200B;

Originally, we had discussed integrating with his development team (working with them on an initial model of the aforementioned “score”) - then, as the initial model is productionalized, I would switch to data-driven content creation (data viz, dashboards, articles and presentations for non-tech users) to help in communicating technical aspects the product internally, and marketing the product externally, an area of the field I enjoy. Great.

&#x200B;

Well, we negotiated equity, and I sign-on, and it turns out I’m the first (and only) full-time employee. The development team is all freelance. The company has no data engineers, so the founder has asked me for guidance on setting up historical data from an API on our own servers. The extent of my data engineering knowledge is: I’ve used SQL to connect to preexisting architectures, and I’ve seen people use Spark/Hive/Hadoop. I’m researching Apache Airflow like a madman, but (obviously) in way over my head.

&#x200B;

He also wants me to spearhead the marketing campaign. There is no website. There is no chosen domain. But I’ve had dozens of pages of “marketing book notes” delivered to me, and I’m supposed to turn it into some kind of plan for my own content, then execute said plan. He wants me to be the lead on creating strategic partnerships within the industry. While I love ""making things"" (I'm also a YT/podcast content creator for fun), I’m not a marketer at whatsoever and don't have some big list of in-industry contacts, so... I’m just completely in the dark there.

I know a ton of people would just peace out and look for another job, but since I've got no other options at the moment: for those who have been in similar situations and stuck it out: who’ve dealt with a founder/boss with unrealistic expectations re: what one entry-level data scientist can do, I’d love to hear how you went about A) your work (what tools/resources) you saught-out and B) how you handled communicating unrealistic expectations while still doing your level-best to rise to the occasion.

1144,What hiring managers are really looking for,503,fvgx3n,datascience,113,"I’ve been following this sub for awhile, and am currently in the middle of a few hiring processes for data analysts/ scientists. I work for a midsized SaaS company as an embedded and thought I’d share what we are really looking for! 
* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the “whole board” they’re seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you’ve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren’t taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**EDIT TO ADD:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven’t developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You’d be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. “Tell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem”. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* Re: starting my own business and my skill level - obviously I’m not 100% at all of these things. No one is! We all have areas to grow. Also, I don’t want to work on my own.

* Per a comment, I cleaned up my formatting :)

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok. Lean on what you're good at, have an attitude that focuses on continuous learning, and be a strong team player."

1148,Text classification service API or docker image recommendations,4,fv1itk,datascience,3,"I have a website that organizes factual claims and allows the community to rate them based on objective qualities.  One current feature associated with each claim is called ""topics"".  I'm considering a redesign where topics are calculated automatically based on the contents of the claim, its sources, and its evidence provided.

Technology is no bother for me, as I built the website from the ground up.  However, I know next to nothing about data science.  I've spent most of today researching where I even need to begin.

What I think I'm looking for is called Text Classification.  Here's what I imagine my process would look like.

1. Certain users sometimes enter topics with each claim.  When they do, the back-end will take that opportunity to train a model with the user provided topics.  Maybe I have to spend some time training the model myself, which is fine.  Who trains it doesn't matter, but I would like the model to be trained against a specific set of topics.  This could eventually be in the thousands.
2. Certain users take advantage of auto-tagging of topics, and the claim document is then submitted to the text classification service by the back-end where it will predict one to many topics automatically.
3. Depending on other services provided by the text classification solution, it may also be used for fuzzy searching and trending topics.

Here's where I'm uncertain:

1. Am I on the right track with text classification as the right solution to this problem?  I've seen several tools for ""text annotation"" but those seem more interactive, and tied to recognizing existing named entities, whereas I want to train the model against a more tailored lexicon (train a document against a topic/category/label/whatever).
2. Most examples I saw while researching only used one topic to train one document, and got only one topic in return when predicting a document.  I am looking for a solution where I can provide many topics per doc in training, and get many topics back when predicting.
3. Does training end, or is it continuous?  Is there such a thing as over-training?  I'd also need to factor in storage size for trained topics, especially if it is continuous.
4. Can text classification be used to determine topics that are trending and fading?  Or, is that a different data science approach/solution?
5. I think I found what I need in GCP [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) Natural Languare Processing API, but it is too expensive ($5 per 1000 doc predictions!?).
6. And, assuming I'm on the right track with all of this, does anyone know of any production-ready service API's or docker images out there, or even libraries I could integrate with or build a service around?  I'm technology agnostic and am comfortable in many languages including python.  But, most everything I've found seems one-off, white-paper-ish, experimental, small-scale (i.e. in-memory only), etc...  Here are the ones that seemed closest to what I want to do:
   1. [natural](https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural) \- node toolsuite with most everything I think I need, but would need to build up persistence storage and run benchmarking to assess its scalability.
   2. [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy) \- Seems more UI human interaction focused, rather than API driven.  And, not sure about custom lexicon given the emphasis on general annotation.
   3. [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) \- Same comments as [prodi.gy](https://prodi.gy), but  got excited when I saw they had a docker image. Didn't seem like the right solution for my problem, though.
   4. [cortex](https://www.cortex.dev/) \- AWS based, service based, but wasn't clear on how they offer text classification at all.  I wondered if I could makeshift their sentiment analysis just using a custom  topics.  I could work with AWS, but it's not my first choice
   5. [monkeylearn.com](https://monkeylearn.com) and various other services that aren't upfront about pricing or are just too expensive.
   6. [xgboost.readthedocs.io](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) \- here's one that I believe is production ready and \*probably\*, but I have a hard time figuring out what the heck it does or what I do with it!
   7. [klassify](https://github.com/fatiherikli/klassify) \- This one seemed the most straightforward, and closest to what I'm trying to do, has a docker image, works with redis, and so it seems scalable.  But, I wasn't sure if anyone had any experience with it or if it meets my requirement of pulling multiple topics out of one document (at first glance it only seems to work with one).

Appreciate any help on the matter!  I have a [sandbox](https://sandbox.thinkards.org) up if that helps gauge what the website abilities are.  I'm aware the UI/UX needs some work, and I am working on it (that's at least two things I'm clueless on)!

**Edit**: Some spelling and grammar fixes, and added xgboost and klassify to my list of researched tools."
1149,htmlcreator: build standalone HTML documents from Python,14,fuzwli,datascience,9,"I often find myself in need to share my findings (mainly tables and pictures) with collaborators. When I started working in Data Science I was using Jupyter Notebook a lot, so I usually exported .ipynb to .html and voilà. But over years I switched completely from notebooks to scripts (even though I love new Jupyter Lab). Without notebooks, creating standalone HTML file with images and tables wasn't easy anymore. I couldn't find simple Python package to help me with that, so I created my own one: [htmlcreator](https://pypi.org/project/htmlcreator).

It exposes simple API for creating standalone HTML files from Python code containing text, images and tables embedded inside. It has also default styling (CSS), so everything looks nicer. I've been using it for around 2 years now and recently decided to publish it, so others can use it too.

I have a question. I'm thinking about doing a minor in data science and later on maby a master. I'm doing a bachelor in marketing, and right now I'm doing an internship in marketing insights (research). I have really taken an interest in data and statistics and also data science. I would love to learn more about it but there is one thing holding me back.

 I am dyslectic and I have discalculia, both diagnosed at a very young age. There both not as severe now that I'm older. Mainly I'm bad at spelling and mental arithmetics. But I will also  misread numbers or letters or remember them wrong fairly often. So this might lead to small errors here and there.

On my current internship it's not a super big deal because we always look over everyone's work before sending it out anyway. 

But I guess my question is to anyone reading, is it a stupid idea to get into data science with these learning disabilities because I'm probably more prone to making errors? 
If there is anyone working (or studying) in data science who is dyslectic or has discalculia I would love to hear about your experience.
Don't be afraid to give me an honest answer, I want to know.

So far the closest I've seen to what I want is the [JHU part-time online data science master's](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs-and-courses/programs/data-science), but they have the weird requirement of C++ as a pre-req (at least it seems weird to me).

Ive run into issues with smaller companies  doing one of two things:

1.  Sending me a case study that is 10 plus hours long prior to any sort of interview with the hiring manager so I don't even know if id want the job or not.
2. Asking for an extensive amount of coding and work far beyond 10 hours.  like if you want to have a complex coding problem with large data files with tons of issues, its kind of bullshit to ask for a powerpoint on top of it

Ive been a hiring manager myself in the data science field for about 5 years hired maybe 5-6 entry level data scientist/analyst throughout my career.  And was always mindful to keep any work I sent them to very brief and just enough to show that they could do the basics.

It really rubs me the wrong way when a company sends me a case study prior to having the hiring manager taking 5 minutes to discuss the opportunity with you over the phone.   I just got ghosted by a hr person at a company who sent me a case study as the first part of the process and never took the time to confirm he even received it or give feedback.

1166,Seeking Feedback on Data Science Workflow Tool,1,fsif1v,datascience,3,"I'm excited (and nervous) to share a product I've been working on for the past few months to get feedback from this community. While I'm more of a *heavy* lurker, /r/datascience has always been an excellent source of discovery and insights for Data Scientists both new and experienced.

I've seen a lot of frustrations when it comes to making Data Science effective in an organization. Issues like:

- Complicated tooling and configurations
- Lack of pipeline and data testing
- Lack of visibility into projects as they start to expand in complexity
- Being forced to wear hats for every step of the end-to-end data cycle
- Different data teams operating in silos
- Lack of access to required cloud resources
- Projects rarely making it to production

All of these issues make it difficult for a Data Science team to drive value and build trust. But I don't think it should have to be that way.

With these frustrations in mind, I set out to build a workflow platform - [Shipyard](https://www.shipyardapp.com) - that helps eliminate the friction of getting solutions to production so Data Scientists can focus more on Data, not DevOps.

To be brief, we've designed the platform to:

- Launch solutions with no DevOps or complicated setups involved. We're cloud-native and handle all scaling on your behalf.
- Orchestrate solutions across teams to create complex pipelines with no edits or additions to your code.
- Monitor and alert on the status of hundreds of solutions for peace of mind.
- Share custom, repeatable solutions with the larger organization using Blueprints.

We're still in the early stages, so I'm looking for anyone that might be interested in testing us out and providing feedback. It's 100% free right now in exchange for your feedback. If you're interested, let me know.

Either way, I'd love to hear the tools currently being used to manage workflows/pipelines and any problems you may be facing with them right now."
1167,Estimating Covid-19 Infections based on Reported Deaths,0,fsej3k,datascience,18,"Since the number of test varies significantly between individual countries, and no country is is even close to reaching 100% test coverage, the reported infections have to be taken with a gigantic grain of salt. However, reported deaths should be much more accurate, since everybody who dies as a consequence of a covid infection pretty much has to be ""in the system"".

So I tried to find a way to ""backtrack"" actual infection numbers based on reported deaths and some other parameters. The calculation could look something like this:

**Assumptions**

* Number of infections is doubling every 3 days
* It takes on average 12 days from infection to death
* Case fatality rate is 2.5%
* There are 100 new deaths reported today

**Calclulation**

* We know, that the people who died today have been infected about 12 days ago. Since 2.5% of infected people die, we can now calculate the number of people who were newly infected 12 days ago with n=100/0.025 = 4000
* We know, that the number of infections doubles every 3 days. Therefore, the number of newly infected people today has to equate, all things being equal, 2^((12 / 3)) = 16 times the amount of 12 days ago. Thus, we can assume that, today 16\*4000=64000 people will be infected
* We can run this calculation for every date, resulting in a timeseries of (new)infections
* We can take the cumulative sum of that timeseries to retrieve the final timeseries of cumulative total estimated infections

&#x200B;

I created a little tool using streamlit to visualize the timeseries and play around with the assumptions for different countries:

1168,Focus on Data Science vs. Deep Learning?,2,fsc7hr,datascience,10,"Hello, fellow Data Scientists,   


With the current lockdown for COVID, I found myself with a decent amount of free time on my hands that I wish to repurpose for my own growth. 

I'm a junior data scientist, working more on the MLE side of things (but also building models). 

I seek advice regarding the following: 

  
A. I can invest this out-of-work time to develop my current work skills:   

- Python: improve from intermediate+ (design and write better OOP, develop a more software dev style of coding)   

- Statistics: Still using out of college knowledge, can get more developed at abstraction, intuition, and baking in more stats in my general intuition (that comes with time and practice but I feel I can learn more on this end)   

- Cloud Dev (aka) MLOps: I've been some work on that end, seems very interesting to me as I come from an engineering background


B. Pick up a completely new skill: Deep Learning: 
I know just enough from school to say I trained a Neural Network, I'm not familiar with the details, the Keras/PyTorch feud nor advanced hyperparameter tunning. Either I can invest in the famous Coursera DL bundle, or Udacity or whichever fits. 


Whenever you think about these choices, think employability, job proofing and well expanding my skillset. On one hand, mastering one's job is essential so A would be great, but it only covers so much of the field."

Although, we do face some challenges even today. But by documenting everything we are able to streamline a lot of things in the team. And now I feel it's time to appreciate the extra efforts my team has been putting in.

Would you mind sharing some of the best practises to celebrate the success remotely?

Thanks in advance :) Stay Safe!!"

We have just released MLFinLab 0.8.0 which includes a couple of bug fixes and the new [Tail Set Labeling technique](https://mlfinlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementations/labeling_tail_sets.html).

Additionally, we have started a [mentorship program](https://hudsonthames.org/mentorship/) that caters to ambitious students looking to make an impact on open-source and develop a portfolio of work based on financial machine learning.

Finally, we ran a poll to figure out which verticals to focus on for 2020, below are the results.

1174,Thoughts on lower-than-desired metrics for production or output?,2,frx60n,datascience,6,"In my sort of work/project, I was tasked to classify tweets (sentiment analysis). I did the annotation step (farmed it out actually), did the inter rater thing, tried to clean it as best as I could, used a bunch of algorithms, from naive bayes to multilingual Bert to even novel algorithms, but only got an accuracy of about 80%, very little hyperparameter tuning tho (interesting to note tho is that regardless of which method I chose, they're all  quite near that accuracy range of 80%). And tbh man I'm feeling so down about it.

I sort of know why the accuracy isn't very good. Even the annotators and myself were also having some trouble during the annotation per se because there's a lot of nuance and context in the data (and a LOT of sarcasm). Like, there are some items that could really go either way. 

Is real world data really this messy? The text I'm dealing with has so much slang, text speak, different dialects and related languages, typos, all on top of code-switching. I have nothing to base on whether it's a good enough accuracy for me to proceed with my analysis or not. I am tho gonna ask my supervisor/head on their thoughts, as I clearly lack experience.

1192,What’s the simplest way I should’ve answered this conceptual statistics/methodology question in my interview (Market Analyst)?,2,fqzhwd,datascience,10,"Hey all,

So brief summary, I applied for a Market Analyst position (first analyst position in general) and essentially after proving my SQL skills in a few, very tedious interviews beforehand, made it to the final interview (via video, woo!)

It was this last question in this final interview that just threw me off of everything, as I have like no statistical experience/knowledge (except for taking one stats class in early college lol). 

So I know this is probably simpler than I made it out to be in my head, but it being in the moment, and again, my lack of statistical knowledge in general, I literally was stumped. 


Essentially here’s what I was given:

Upon past email marketing survey efforts to a test send group of 10,000 customers, we had a 20% response rate. We then had a control group to 1,000 customers, and had a response rate of 15% with them. 

We want to lower the control group and yet, be confident we can measure the response rate with statistical significance. What would you recommend?


So basically, I pulled stuff out my ass with things like “further personalization of the designs of these email surveys as we decrease the control group size, as well as trigger(automate) emails to send surveys out in a more timely manner” (LOL) etc etc; knowing damn well that this problem isn’t really focused on the process or design of the survey itself.

They tried giving me a hint saying that this is supposed to be conceptual and there’s no one right answer and they don’t need exact calculations or anything but more of the statistical thought process one would go through for this experiment.


The only stats I remember was like simple t-tests (one sample and independent samples) but I’m rusty in both concepts and definitely need to go back and refresh every little thing about them. Plus, wasn’t even sure if this scenario even constitutes those two tests lol. 

I was feeling so good up until then since literally all of the other interviews and questions were about SQL and they were really impressed by my queries and such. And on top of that, they said most of the day to day is SQL so I felt like this might be my first analyst position I could finally land.

But what’s done is done and as I wait for a decision, I wanted to see what thought process you guys would’ve essentially said (in simplest terms?) so that I can learn and just be able to familiarize myself with some of these terminologies for future references.

Thanks in advance for any input on the matter~

EDIT: should’ve added their response when I asked for general clarification:


“So let’s say whatever lower control group we chose, we saw that the new response rate was 10%. How do we know that that given response rate can be trusted and significant? “

“Again, don’t focus on the actual value of the new response rate. It could be 15% or 20%. We just wanted to know how you’d go about saying that this response rate was not just an anomoly but can be trusted in the sense that in the future if we wanted to use the same control group number then we can expect that same response rate?”"

As you all know, governments across the planet are struggling to contain the spread of Covid-19. The reason behind this is simple: things are moving too quickly making it extremely difficult to keep track of what is happening and where it is happening. The answer is simple: **DATA**!

Until treatments and vaccines are developed, data is our greatest weapon against Covid-19, and it’s about time we used it. We are launching a global survey to collect and analyze data from citizens across the planet - the first of its kind in history- to help governments and our communities in their battle against the greatest challenge of the Internet Age.

All we are asking for is four minutes of your time to share this post and fill out this simple, completely anonymous survey that can save thousands, if not millions of lives, as well as the livelihoods of most small business owners and day laborers. If you answer these questions as accurately as possible, you will provide us with extremely valuable information that can reveal where outbreak zones are and how they have been developing over the past few weeks. That means seeing an early end to the mass quarantine measures currently being employed and enforced around the planet.

**How?** Well, for example, if thirty people on your block report that they have symptoms consistent with Covid-19, your local government will be able to act quickly to treat patients, contain the local spread, and warn those on your block to take extra steps to safeguard themselves. You yourself will be more cautious and will have a direct view of your neighborhood's status regarding the coronavirus.

Imagine the network effect, and application of wisdom of the crowd to actually get more insight and provide a new angle to specialist & data analysts to come-up with the most impactful solutions.

All of this anonymous information will be released daily on Kaggle and Github so that researchers, data scientists, companies and governments can quickly access and analyze it.

1215,Books/Resources to learn Python or R to Get Into Data Science (Data Analytics),4,fqa8tr,datascience,9,"Hey all. I wanted to get into the data analytic world and was wondering what books would be the best in order to have a good foundation so that I can work on my own projects for applying to jobs. I am a senior that recently switched from applied math to probability and statistics thinking that I would have a better chance of having a job that I would enjoy.  I don't plan on getting my masters and I know that the term data science is very ambiguous and it mostly means data analytics which is most likely what I would like to pursue. I learned a little bit of Java but I would definitely not call myself an intermediate in programming. I looked around the subreddit and heard that ""R for Data Science"" by Hadley Wickham have been quite praised. But I heard that python is often used more in data science and it's a more ""general"" language such that the knowledge you have for python can be transferred over to R or anything else.  I also heard that python is used more if you want to get into tech. I am quite new so any insight on where to start would be appreciated. I live in California and wish to have a job somewhere in the west coast. Thanks!"
1216,Amazon Applied Scientist Position,5,fq5wph,datascience,8,"So over the long-term I’m really interested in Amazon’s Applied Scientist position. I may get a Master’s in the future, but I’m currently self-teaching by going through Elements of Statistical Learning as well as Statistical Inference. Other than that, once I finish up some interviews I have lined up, I plan on reading through papers, implementing them, and recording results in a blog format. I don’t really see the reason for a graduate degree if I’m able to effectively self-study, but I also just want to plan a bit. Is it at all feasible to attempt getting a position like this without a graduate degree given I show enough initiative and actually put forth the time and effort to learn (not just writing a small project using TF and then saying I’m an ML expert)?"

1218,"People who prefer R over python, what's your rationale?",387,fq2k7w,datascience,369,"I've been using python for \~3-4 years now. A couple classes at uni used R and the feeling was generally the same - ""I already know how to do this in python, relearning how to do the same task in another  language is an unnecessary burden."" But with libraries like reticulate and rpy2, being able to mix these languages together is becoming increasingly easy.

I'm curious what things are so easy in R, you'd never consider doing it in python? Tasks R is better suited for? Or more generally, why do you prefer R?

1219,Prediction or insight?,8,fq1bqo,datascience,4,"I am fairly new in a Data Scientist position, so I thought I'ld come here to align what may be a false expectation I had. I am working right now in a project for a company that wants to extract useful things from its database. They don't know exactly what they are looking for, but they expect to see magic spontaneously happening; nothing new in the front. 

This void of a clear target is starting to be a real problem for me. My boss appear to be following his client's expectation: we are making a lot of graphs with a lot of potential things that may be going on. The problem is, whenever I try to predict some import outcome (like the probability of default), all these previous insights that we extracted don't seem to hold water. The accuracy of any model that I fit is pathetic. This, for me, is a real warning sign suggesting that we should change our approach to the client; we are basically telling fairy tales to him and suffering in the way trying to find these bs correlations.

How should I approach this situation? My north always used to be predictability (if this information does not help me predict a situation, then it is not useful), but maybe I am being too dogmatic?

1223,[R] StellarGraph version 0.11 open-source Python Machine Learning Library for graphs just released,8,fpplby,datascience,0,"StellarGraph is an open-source library featuring state-of-the-art graph machine learning algorithms. The project is delivered as part of CSIRO's Data61.

Five algorithms and streamlined onboarding are only some of the major new features delivered in the [0.11 release](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/releases/tag/v0.11.0) of the library, with substantial API, documentation and demo improvements to support users in running and exploring StellarGraph functionality.

New algorithms include:

* Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them.
* Deep Graph Infomax: performs unsupervised node representation learning.
* Temporal Random Walks (Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings): random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred.
* ComplEx: computes multiplicative complex-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.
* DistMult: computes multiplicative real-number embeddings for entities and relationships (edge types) in knowledge graphs, used for link prediction.[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/issues/755)

A sixth algorithm remains under active development, but is available in this release as an experimental preview:

* GCNSupervisedGraphClassification: supervised graph classification model based on Graph Convolutional layers (GCN).

The new release incorporates extensive enhancements and bug fixes, some of which include: 

* StellarGraph.to\_adjacency\_matrix is at least 15 times faster on undirected graphs[ ](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/pull/932)
* ClusterNodeGenerator is noticeably faster, reducing the time taken to train and predict with a ClusterGCN model 
* Addition of a subgraph method for computing a node-induced subgraph
* Addition of a connected\_components method for computing the nodes involved in each connected component in a StellarGraph
* The info method has been improved for heterogeneous graphs with many types and also shows information about the size and type of each node type's feature vectors
* Four new datasets added to stellargraph.datasets
* Neo4j functionality is now tested on CI
* Example Jupyter notebooks can now be run directly in Google Colab and Binder
* New notebooks demonstrating how to construct a StellarGraph object from Pandas, and from NetworkX.

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) to access StellarGraph and explore these enhancements. Details for breaking changes can also be reviewed here.  

We welcome your feedback and contributions.

Until next time, the StellarGraph team."
1224,Should I standardize/normalize the dependent variable if I standardize/normalize independent?,1,fpomd3,datascience,2,"I'm running the multiple linear regression (for now) to predict the revenue. From many IVs (some categorical some with low values) one is a 'budget' variable, which has a large scale (in millions).

So for the 'budget' not to have a massive disturbance on the variance I plan to standardize/normalize or use log. If I decide to do any of the above-mentioned methods should I also apply the same method to the DV ?

Both revenue(DV) and budget(IV) are scaled from several million up to hundreds of millions"
1225,How do you keep local data files ? Do you sync them up to a database / google drive? I'm confused about workflow,3,fpmubr,datascience,13,"
The problem is that we sync our code up with git, but the data is stored
locally. So that if someone else wants to run the code or something there's
an issue.

The data comes from a mixture of sources

* most is from Google Storage
* some is from data scraping / whatever during the project
* some is processed data

I was thinking about having a local directory rsynced up to the data storage,
and sync on git pushes with a git hook.

An issue with this is that there would be duplication of data, for example,
if I have some `data.csv`, then it might originally be located at

```
storage/bucket_1/data.csv
```
I pull this down to my local project
```
project/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
and then I sync my local data up to storage again, putting it at
```
storage/bucket_2/data/thing/raw/data.csv
```
So that data now exists in two places, which isn't so great.

I'm not aware of a process to prevent this though and would appreciate any
thoughts/considerations that others have.

If you are bored and need something to fill your time I got the perfect solution for you. Could you fill out a questionnaire for a study I am doing? My data collection is not going well and I really need some participants. Furthermore, some of the items are pretty interesting and could help you dealing with the quarantine boredom (if it is present). So it's basically a win/win. My study is about the relationship between future self-continuity (do we feel connected to our future self or not) and moral decision making. In other words, I want to see whether the degree of our perceived connectedness to ourselves in the future is related to decisions we make about moral dilemmas.

**The questionnaire is for Italian speakers only.** This is an exploratory study and it would require approximately 40 minutes of your time. If you are interested you can check out the link below:

1234,Mahalanobis Distance out of two other Mahalanobis Distances,1,fpctf3,datascience,2,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, but it seemed like the best one since Mahalanobis distance seems to be used for Machine Learning as well. This is for a work in Management though, so not Data Science per se, more Data Science adjacent I suppose.

After getting my head around the Mahalanobis distance, I found statistical significance in the variables I am using calculated with it. There is a pretty established author that measures the same thing I am trying to, and they publish their Mahalanobis Distances, but not their component variables, being that they use different variables to measure this construct. Their variables, and process of recovery is so obscure that it is unlikely that I'd be able to access them myself.

So, to get to the point as quickly as possible, I've was wondering if it is even worth it to look into if it is theoretically sound to aggregate two Mahalanobis Distances with the Mahalanobis Distance, for the same subjects. 

Or would it be better for me to use those my variables and include that distance as another variable. In the same vein, should some ponderation be made regarding how many variables each Mahalanobis distance computes?

I'm still looking at understanding better how Mahalanobis works, but if you guys could offer some input that would be great!"

1236,Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),285,fpcltw,datascience,171,"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how. To throw this concept to the garbage can so that HR can have better leads on candidates feels a bit insulting."

My question is, which one is practiced more often in the DS field and which one would you advise mastering?

in `statsmodel` I like that you can used method *summary()* to print all the details and metrics of the regression, is there something similar for the `sklearn`? 

Also, I noticed that `sklearn` is easier for various plotting. However, I can simply use `seaborn` library.

thanks"

As far as I can tell, to predict the expected hours for every position type, requires a seperate model for every position type. My case is that there a lot of different positions, and potentially a very large amount of models to essentially create one dataset.

What is an efficient way to tackle this? Should I automate modelling for every y is there a better way to think about this problem?"

1273,Big data or data engineering for NLP?,0,fo3d8f,datascience,5,"I am trying to find if  it makes sense that they often happen together: NLP, and data engineering or big data techniques (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, and Scala)

One classic example in Hadoop MapReduce is word count. I guess that doesn't count as NLP.

1. In NLP industrial positions, do natural language data often need data engineering or big data techniques, i.e. do natural language data often come as ""big data""? 

   Internet search engines likely require big data of natural language, but I guess there  are very few Internet search engine job positions.  Do most information retrieval positions also need to worry about big data? How about  other NLP applications.?

2. Natural languages are unstructured data. However, https://www.dataversity.net/natural-language-processing-big-data-powerful-combination/ said in 2014:

  > As developed as big data analytics have become, they still really only excel at managing structured information.


  Have big data or data engineering techniques evolve for NLP already? If yes, how well are  NLP aware big data or data engineering techniques received in industry?


  Is it more often to convert natural language data to structured data, and then apply big data or data engineering techniques, or to apply  NLP aware big data or data engineering techniques directly to NLP big data?

3. Some other observerations and thoughts?

1280,"Seeking collaborators with expertise in: data science, advanced signal processing, machine learning, computational modeling, graph-theoretic/network analysis",0,fnnbh7,datascience,0,"I am starting a new lab this fall at Florida International University (FIU). Our lab will focus on **understanding the neurocognitive processes that allow for the emergence of cognitive control** (how the human brain/mind monitors and adapts itself overtime to achieve task goals). Moreover, we will seek to understand how this system develops across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. Towards this end, methods that I currently employ, include: (single-trial) ERP analyses, time-frequency analyses of EEG (power and phase relations), source-localization of EEG, traditional fMRI approaches (GLM-based), and basic computational modeling (drift-diffusion models). Our lab is currently purchasing a high-density EEG system and FIU houses an fMRI scanner.

I am **seeking collaborators** that may or may not currently work in the fields of psychology or neuroscience, but that have at least some **expertise in one or more of the following domains: data science, advanced signal processing, machine learning, computational modeling, graph-theoretic/network analysis.** *I am most interested in finding collaborators that can help generate the best science; location, status, affiliation, or degrees earned are not important.* I also intend to take on at least one PhD student this fall and welcome responses from prospective students.

The scientific goal of this collaboration will be to combine skillsets in order to test novel hypotheses regarding the human cognitive control system, its developmental trajectory across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. At a practical level, we would seek to produce high-impact publications and to generate pilot data for pursuing collaborative grant proposals. **Depending on the situation, initial funding may be available for potential collaborators, consultants, or contractors.**

Mathematical Foundations

These courses are intended to help lay the foundation for learning more advanced maths, as well as foster the development of mathematical thinking. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Introduction to Logic, Stanford (course)
This course is an introduction to Logic from a computational perspective. It shows how to encode information in the form of logical sentences; it shows how to reason with information in this form; and it provides an overview of logic technology and its applications - in mathematics, science, engineering, business, law, and so forth.

Introduction to Mathematical Thinking, Stanford (course)
Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.

Statistics & Probability

Statistics and probability are the foundations of data science, more so than any other family of mathematical concepts. These courses will help prepare you to look at data through the statistical lens and with a critical probabilistic eye. Descriptions come directly from the respective course websites.

Statistics and probability, Khan Academy (course)
Course covers analyzing categorical data, displaying and comparing quantitative data, summarizing quantitative data, modeling data distributions, exploring bivariate numerical data, study design, probability, counting, permutations, and combinations, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, two-sample inference for the difference between groups, inference for categorical data, advanced regression, analysis of variance

Fundamentals of Statistics, MIT (course)
Statistics is the science of turning data into insights and ultimately decisions. Behind recent advances in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental statistical principles. The purpose of this class is to develop and understand these core ideas on firm mathematical grounds starting from the construction of estimators and tests, as well as an analysis of their asymptotic performance

Data Science: Probability, Harvard (course)
We will introduce important concepts such as random variables, independence, Monte Carlo simulations, expected values, standard errors, and the Central Limit Theorem. These statistical concepts are fundamental to conducting statistical tests on data and understanding whether the data you are analyzing is likely occurring due to an experimental method or to chance.

Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data, MIT (course)
The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including: multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions, laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)

Improving your statistical inferences, Eindhoven University of Technology (course)
First, we will discuss how to correctly interpret p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, Bayes Factors, and likelihood ratios, and how these statistics answer different questions you might be interested in. Then, you will learn how to design experiments where the false positive rate is controlled, and how to decide upon the sample size for your study, for example in order to achieve high statistical power. Subsequently, you will learn how to interpret evidence in the scientific literature given widespread publication bias, for example by learning about p-curve analysis. Finally, we will talk about how to do philosophy of science, theory construction, and cumulative science, including how to perform replication studies, why and how to pre-register your experiment, and how to share your results following Open Science principles.

Introduction to Probability and Data, Duke University (course)
This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.

Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft (course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London (specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it’s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science."

1297,job searching during COVID-19,0,fn4zoq,datascience,6,"I got my Masters in ECE from a good school 2 years ago, and I did an internship as a data scientist. After graduating I got data science offers but I ended up taking a job at a manufacturing site at a well known Fortune 100 company due to the high offer. I thought it'd be interesting to apply machine learning to a production environment. Unfortunately, only about 20% of my work deals with machine learning or data science.

Worst part is, the environment I'm in frowns upon working from home, even during this COVID-19 crisis. I really want out, and get a data science position in the next 3 month, preferably out in the West Coast but I'll take anything that's decent. I'm seriously considering quitting. I got $100k saved so I should survive for awhile. Just wonder how bad it's gonna look to future employers, and also I don't know the time frame to get a data science job in this recession...

1301,Why use logarithm ?,1,fmyt50,datascience,9,"Hi everyone!

On the Johns Hopkins map to see the evolution of the Coronavirus ( https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html ), they plot the actual number of cases and recoveries but they also plot the same graph but using the logarithm

A friend of mine told me that it's to better see ""the speed"" of how those curves evolve but I really have trouble to understand what is the reality behind

Like in the ""Actual"" plot, the yellow curve seems to be at almost 0 until mid February, yet in the ""Logarithmic"" plot it went off from the beginning
Ok the log function is more significant for lower values but in that case does it really represents the speed of its evolution?

1302,[COVID-19] How to estimate the current number of cases for the countries that have inadequate/unreliable data?,0,fmydog,datascience,3,"Hello everyone! Any opinions on how to calculate a probabilistic estimate of number of existing cases for a country/city given the data for neighboring countries?

I live in a country in which the government is being dishonest. The tests-per-million is about 100s and therefore number of confirmed cases is very low. The government declares this as a success but IMO it's actually way more. They don't declare the location of confirmed cases or any other stats.  What's worse is that the people do not get how serious the situation is and they act nonchalantly. 

It would be great if a simple and convincing model could give estimates on actual cases."

I have been preparing quite a lot to interview for full time positions by practicing lots of SQL, python, general product sense questions, when to use what algorithm, tradeoffs, general things about my resume, myself, etc. Bascially I am trying to leave no stone unturned when it comes to what could be asked in an interview (specifically the FB Data Science, Analyst interview, which I will be scheduling soon. I've already read the threads about this specific interview in the sub. As a disclaimer, I'm not looking for NDA info, just prep in general). A little more context about myself: I'll be graduating in June with a B.Eng in Business Informatics and have been working in a Data Science position for a business consulting agency (not USA) for a little less than a year now. 

Now I'm aware one thing is knowing about something and another is being able to communicate / demonstrate in an interview setting, so I have been looking for places to have practice interviews (websites mostly). I have found a couple (e.g. Pramp) but would love to hear this community's recommendations, what has worked for you, etc.

Also, if anyone is willing to practice interview me I have no problem with paying.

1314,How do you peer review Data Science projects?,0,fmi3ib,datascience,0,"Hey everyone. :)

I'm Shay (written erroneously; pronounced Shy), a data science consultant out of Israel.

I've been dedicating a lot of thought to peer review in small data science teams (like the ones I use to run, and now consult to). Sure, some of it entails reviewing code, but a lot of our work products and processes are different, and require, I believe, a dedicated peer review process.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the topic. Is peer review a regular part of the work process in your team? Have you reviewed or been reviewed by a peer? What is your approach? What do you feel is still missing? Have you encountered any structured approaches to this process that are unique to DS/ML teams - especially small ones, where 1 project = 1 data scientist?

If you're interested in my approach so far - which we have started implementing at one of my clients', and I've actually reviewed a DS project using this procedure - you are more than welcome to take a look at this blog post, and shout at me for all of my mistakes (friends link, so no paywall): 😗

1316,Best countries to immigrate to as a Data Scientist - from Iran!,0,fmdzhr,datascience,23,"Hey Everyone,

So after a decade of work as an economic analyst, business analyst and data scientist in Iran, I have come to realize that the local economy has zero interest in transforming into a more data-driven state. Data resources are scarce and something as crucial as EDA is frowned upon out of fear that it may expose financial corruption, contradict government-provided statistics, etc. The most exciting thing that could happen in a data scientist’s life here is creating recommender systems for e-commerce platforms, the ones that have not gone under as results of sanctions anyway.

Situation is so severe that the job search term “Data Scientist” which returns tons of opportunities for other nations, offers next to nothing in Iran (Try this with LinkedIn yourselves for an impression of what I am talking about.)

I’m 32, B.Sc. in Industrial Mathematics, M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering, (specializing in Technology Foresight and Sustainable Development) both from top technology schools in Iran. I do have a fairly solid track record in quantitative business analysis/development.

This great community has always helped me make informed decisions. I would welcome any advice as to which countries offer better prospects for an aspiring data person. I do realize that I may have to start by interning at a new company overseas and I am humble enough to do just that.

I'm gonna ask broad questions to try to gather as much feedback as I can and then decide what to do. Everything is a possibility at this stage, there are no right or wrong. I have some data background but it's not relevant and that's why I'm a bit stuck with my thoughts.

**Objective:** Create kind of an Hackaton/program with a company where at the end of the day Data is transformed into relevant business insights. Those insights will be capitalized to generate possible new business models.

**Some questions about:**

**People:** 

\- Should we have several teams working with data? how many people per team, 1 or more? how can they work together - can we assign several roles like: 1 to cross data, 1 to clean the data, etc (is this stupid? lol) ?

\- Are these people data scientists only? Should we have 1 business guy per team to give a different perspective?

\- Should we have Data Scientists in the morning and then business people during the evening?

**Data:** 

\- Should we start with raw data?

\- All the teams should start with the same Data?

\- Should we try to cross data from company with some public government data or other sources?

**Program:** 

\- A morning, 12h, 24h, 2 days? How much time do we need?

\- Should we specify some avenues to explore or let them search for everything?

\- What are the things I have to take into account?

&#x200B;

I Know this is all too broad, vague, open and your answer will be ""It all depends on what you want"", but what I need here is your expertise and sensitivity. If it was you, what would you do, how and why? Do you have anything that had been done before as a good example?

I ask of you, please take into consideration data science is only useful for exploratory analysis at this point. Please take into account that current common tools in ""data science"" are ""bias reinforcers"", not great to predict on fat and long tailed distributions. The algorithms are not objective and there's epidemiologists, virologists (read data scientists) who can do a better job at this than you. Statistical analysis will eat machine learning in this task. Don't pretend to use AI, it won't work.

Don't pretend to crowd source over kaggle, your data is old and stale the moment it comes out unless the outbreak has fully ended for a month in your data. If you have a skill you also need the expertise of people IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE. If your best work is overfitting some algorithm to be a kaggle ""grand master"" then please seriously consider studying decision making under risk and uncertainty and refrain from giving advice.

Machine learning is label (or bias) based, take into account that the labels could be wrong that the cleaning operations are wrong. If you really want to help, look to see if there's teams of doctors or healthcare professionals who need help. Don't create a team of non-subject-matter-expert ""data scientists"". Have people who understand biology.

I know people see this as an opportunity to become famous and build a portfolio and some others see it as an opportunity to help. If you're the type that wants to be famous, trust me you won't. You can't bring a knife (logistic regression) to a tank fight."

I am working as Data Scientist for 2 years in a startup in Bangalore, including internship where most of my work had data cleaning and data wrangling profile. It has been 1.5 years working as one.

One of them is Super Resolution and OCR (Japanese, has very little literature to go through ) and Super Resolution for text images for English and Japanese (again , a challenging and subjective as per buisness problem). The thing is the management thinks that if a paper is published for super resolution it will work on our data too, plus the Data science manager is sort of ""yes sir"" guy and makes us work on simply hit and trial, as of two years one thing I am sure that Data Science is not just simply trying anything till we reach accuracy without going through in details. The learning curve has just gone down to trying tessarct, kraken etc and same goes for Super resolution, just feed the data and see it works or not. I want to tell the management that it is not worth and we need a better resource on ML and DL who can actually break it down and guide us in a more logical and systematic direction instead of just trying different paper with a dataset which is exactly opposite to ours and trying random things (frameworks, just any random paper published).

So for example, if the label categories are {not_depressed, mild_depression, depressed, suicidal}, the chosen label has been assigned to a user based on the totality of their posts.

Each row of my dataset is an individual post. Some users have up to 500 posts, some have as low as 10. If I concatenate the posts together based on user, the assigned label is accurate but the text sequence length is far too big (average 5k words after cleaning and removing a lot of words). If I don't concatenate but learn based on individual posts, the text sequences are an appropriate size (avg 30 words) but then the model thinks the label is assigned on a post level.

Any tips?"

1357,Working from raw source data from a filepath containing spaces using make and Makefiles,2,fksdx3,datascience,0,"I have a repository that uses python scripts and a Makefile. I want to have a setup procedure that
allows them to easily set up an environment and copy in the necessary data files from our server.

The problem with including the source data files in the Makefile is that the company server uses 
spaces in the drive name, which make doesn't like very much, so I can list those files as dependencies
for the target output file.

My current Makefile basically does only the following:

```
.PHONY : all
all : output.csv

.PHONY : copy_data_to_local_folder
copy_data_to_local_folder :
	python copyfile.py ""V:\\Server Path\\With Spaces\\Inputs 1.csv"" local/inputs1.csv
	python copyfile.py ""V:\\Server Path\\With Spaces\\Inputs 2.csv"" local/inputs2.csv

output.csv : combine_data.R local/inputs1.csv local/inputs2.csv
	Rscript $^ $@
```

The `copy_data_to_local_folder` part is just to get the data to the local directory, but it isn't included 
in the DAG leading to the production of `output.csv` (i.e. `all : output.csv copy_data_to_local_folder`) or else
the target would need to run everytime.

My solution ideas are the following, but I'm not sure what's best practice:

1. **Use a different make tool.** I could use `Luigi` in Python or `Drake` in R, but I would prefer to keep 
the tool somewhat more generalized.

2. **Run a setup script to copy in files.** I assume there would be a way to run the file copying scripts
as part of the environment setup, but I am unfamiliar with how to do this.

I am not sure about the best way to do this. I want to be able to share the code with a co-worker and have them
be able to get up and running on their system without too much messing around to configure. Is there a best
practice for this situation?"

I've tried googling various things and can't get anything to pop up. I'm hoping to find a book or two on the subject.

My particular use-case is: I have lots of variables for voters - age, sex, zip code, etc., I would like to predict if they will vote Democrat or Republican but I only have precinct-level results (precincts vary in size from 2 registered voters to 2,880, but most are around 1,000; I have 8900 precincts). In my mind, a good model would cause my predictions for individuals to create similar results to the actual precinct results when aggregated.

A second, related question - what is generally considered best practice when using census or similar aggregated data as a predictor variable - for instance, if I have the median income for a census block is it ok to simply assign this to an individual living in that census block? This seems a little simplistic, so I was wondering if there are any good resources, particularly books on the subject.

1372,Best way to present/show time series multi-column data?,3,fk7hr8,datascience,2,"Hi everyone, 

I basically have a dozen time points (columns) with a few hundred rows (features).  
Per usual, some features rise and fall together, while others might stay consistent, or be affected in other ways at different times points.

I'm trying to find the best way to 'show' and 'see' which features seem to be related to others rising and falling. A network of sorts. Features X1,X2,X3 drop, and the more they drop, the more features Y1,Y2 rise for example.

Currently I'm taking the change between time points and manually grouping them together, but I'd like a more 'automatic' and ideally '3d' way of seeing a 'network' of changes branching out. (Maybe a group of changes in time stamp 1 result in changes in time stamp 2, etc).

I'm just wondering if anyone knows of a standard way, or maybe a library that does/shows this?

It would be cool to be able to find 'if we remove features A,B, then feature Y should not go up'.

&#x200B;

What I'm currently doing:

Currently my method is really gross and not friendly to visualize. I have the changes between time points. Then I group them into 'increases a lot, increase a little, doesn't change, goes down, goes down a lot'. So 5 branches. Which then branch off into 5 more... and so on and so forth for each time point. I imagine there has to be a significantly cleaner, less noisy, and more 'interactive'/'visual' way to do this.

Last summer, when applying for internships, the bulk of the questions were about my model knowledge (what's the gradient for this?, what's the hyperparameter here do? What assumptions does this model make?) Perhaps these questions are only typical of intern level positions. I ended up getting an awesome internship related to NLP. And the mindset I walked away with was - know your models inside and out; that's what separates the good candidates from the bad. Now I'm thinking at the employee (not intern) level, it's assumed that you already know all this stuff and can further use them to a company's benefit. It sounds obvious in retrospect, but I'm still fumbling to find a winning study strategy from this point on.

However, now the questions are a bit more like:

""What's the probability that a customer will purchase this exact product last month given online transaction history?"" or ""model the impact of discount percentage on sales volume and recommend the optimal discount per product."" or ""predict customer churn given transaction history.""

I completely understand that these are the questions that data scientists are supposed to be answering in industry.

3. Model building from Scratch. I am familiar with the concepts and math but I need more practice on hands-on implementation of end-to-end pipeline.

Just posting because I feel really lost -- manager asks me to put together a sales forecast (they have none), and she tells me she wants to use the forecast in conjunction subject matter experts (marketing) for providing a monthly/quarterly forecast. I clean some data up and use Prophet to provide a forecast, but today during the meeting she tells me that it isn't 'explainable' in any way. The forecast does extremely well, except for the last day of each month where there is usually a huge spike, but when you forecast to the monthly/quarterly level, it performs extremely well. She wants me to put together a forecast using a combination of average opp size/average time to close/pipeline to produce a forecast, which I honestly have very little faith in. We aren't tracking a lot of really basic things (like a snapshot of sales pipeline for example, so simple pipeline analysis is basically out the window), and she seems to think all of this can be done in tableau/excel and 'statistics, which is odd because I told her I was just going to run a time series model weeks ago.' I kind of don't know what to do other than follow her suggestions, despite the fact that I think it will be fairly far off the mark. I don't know how to explain why this method would probably result in failure without coming off across as 'difficult'.

I calculated all my error metrics (which I can't interpret) using the scikit-learn's `metrics` module. I couldn't find a metric that calculated bias, but I read that bias is just the mean error/residual, so I calculated it like this: 

    regressor = LinearRegression()
    regressor.fit(x_train, y_train)
    y_pred = regressor.predict(y_test)
    bias = np.mean(y_test - y_pred)
    >>> -0.06822953408834274

So, my bias isn't zero. Have I done something wrong?"
1393,What approach is commonly taken to go from data aggregation to real-time dashboard?,6,fj98r5,datascience,9,"I am doing research in the smart cities domain. We use IoT devices to collect data, and then send it to a DB (torn between using MongoDB and Cassandra at the moment). Our end goal is to create a real-time dashboard. We're trying to display dynamic results on the dashboard, such as the temperature of an area during a specified date range. Another example is watching the luminosity of an area change in near real time.  


My question is: After the data is in the DB, what is the common approach for creating a real-time dashboard?   


Do you analyze the DB data beforehand, store the results back into the DB (as new tables/collections), and then pull those results from the DB to the webapp?  


OR, do you run the data through an analytics engine like Spark while it's in transit to the webapp? In this case, my understanding is the webapp's backend would run queries to get a bunch of data that's then filtered down by the analysis tool. The filtered data is then sent to the frontend."

But maybe I am wrong and, coming from a purely Python and C++ background, I cannot see the benefits. If some of you, more experiences than me, could share their experience, maybe I could reevaluate my views. Cheers."

1399,Modelling discount effect on sales volume,1,fj2zx8,datascience,0,"Most of my data science experience has been in the realms of NLP, recommender systems, and network analysis. I'm quite unfamiliar with using DS techniques directly for business goals; so I volunteered for a project to help me master some fundamentals. 

I have sales data for 5 products, the discount %, and the dates effective. Assume that there are many, many rows covering every product, the month effective, and the discount percentage.

For example:

    [
    (product_1, 15%, April 2019),
    (product_2, 10%, June 2019),
    (product_3, 20%, October 2019)
    ]

What are some strategies for modelling the effectiveness of discounts on products?

Because there are so many variables, I do not think that A/B testing is appropriate here. I've considered marginalizing date out, and building one  linear regression model for each product where discount is the independent var and sales volume is the dependent variable. 

However, I feel that this question is deceptively easy; perhaps it's actually an optimization problem where we're estimating the best discount price to maximize sales. For example, a $100 product might sell 4 units with 20% off and 5 units with 25% off. But without knowing the cost per item to the business, this isn't a perfect approach either. 

Thoughts?"

Could be anything really I just dont want to go into anything too fancy that will take 80+ hours.

I have to be able to come up with some business use case for this research, but I can probably come up with that for anything.  Ultimately it just has to be useful.

Then I wanted to do child abuse, but the datasets are insane.. like 10000 fields insane... and you are aupposed to use fancy weights and software because of the study design.  So thats out.

For those unfamiliar with Project Euler it has many different mathematical problems many of which are unsolvable by brute force with a programming language. It forces you to think about things in the most efficient way possible and find solutions which are not obvious at first. After you solve the problem you can view a forum thread for that specific problem in which other people post their code for their solutions. It's a lot of fun seeing how your algorithm compares to others and learning ways which your algorithm can be improved. 

I was just wondering if something similar to this exists for machine learning specifically? I'm hoping to try out some different machine learning models in a non-competitive relaxed environment and also have ability to see how others solved the same problem. It would also be great if my progress was tracked and there are achievements (Just like Project Euler!)."

1425,Data science in Recessionary periods,19,fi7q2t,datascience,22,"Some professions in some sectors do OK during recessionary periods. 

- For example if you're an engineer working for a public utility company delivering water and power (because people always need water and electricity). 

- People in healthcare industries also do OK (people always get sick). 

- If you work for a bank, as long as you're front office (revenue generating) and not middle office or back office (cost centers), your jobs will be save.

**What about data scientists?**

We know the recession is coming and it will be pretty bad. Central banks have run out of ammo since interest rates are so low. The only cheap tricks they have is doing QE's so we don't know how long this recession will last. Learning from Japan, it's highly possible we will go bad for a really long time. 

Since data science as a profession is a new thing and since most of the time data scientists is non-revenue generating, what do you guys think will happen in this upcoming recession/depression?

What are your takes on the following professions in different industries:

- data scientists (R&D)

- data engineers

- data analysts (aka: data scientists type A, or FAANG type data scientists)

- BI

- machine learning engineers

I can start: 

If you're any of the above within healthcare, you will surely be OK (data scientists have worked in healthcare sectors for a long time, and they're called statisticians). If you're in retail, perhaps you better have enough emergency funds.

**Edit:** I'd like to take the discussion a step further. An organization will keep you around as long as your value is greater than your costs.

1446,A random idea for tracking Coronavirus,0,fhrdtf,datascience,4,"Testing is a huge problem in the US because there's no testing in the US. Tracking is impossible in any direct sense. 

If you could access data related to general number of flu cases or something similar, you could potentially detect anomalies. Especially if you had very localized data. I'd guess that if it's not being tested, it's just being misdiagnosed/recorded as something else. Like if someone goes to the hospital with flu like symptoms, they probably just write it down as the closest thing matching the symptoms. I would hypothesize if that Coronavirus is spreading in areas served by specific hospitals, you may be able to see it as peaks in similiar illnesses. 


I don't know the signal to noise ratio though and if any data is available at all. I have some data science experience but none of the access to such information. I haven't been able to find a public source either.

It's also possible there could be other potential ways to get some signal, like social media or something like that. All ideas are welcome.

1456,Is LOOCV really high variance?,5,fhiwir,datascience,3,"In *Elements of Statistical Learning*, the authors write

>What value should we choose for K? With K = N [LOOCV], the cross-validation estimator is approximately unbiased for the true (expected) prediction er- ror, but can have high variance because the N “training sets” are so similar to one another. The computational burden is also considerable, requiring N applications of the learning method.

Computational burden is becoming less and less of an obstacle, which leaves variability as a reason not to perform LOOCV.  I've realized that ESL doesn't provide any references for this claim, and I'm ashamed to say I've just accepted it by virtue of having names like Hastie and Tibshirani on the cover.  There aren't even any simulations to substantiate the claim!

A colleague and I had a disagreement on CV scheme, which lead to me being shown [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/61783/bias-and-variance-in-leave-one-out-vs-k-fold-cross-validation/252031#252031) thread on Cross Validated. Seems like (at least from the simulations provided) that LOOCV can be provide unbiased estimates with comparable variability to K-Fold, flying in the face of ESL.

Does anyone know where the rationale for LOOCV being high variance came from, or know of simulations that show it to be high variance? Is this just one of those things we believe because other people believed it?"

1470,Question about Accomplishments at Work,6,fh1phc,datascience,10,"Hi All,

I'm currently about 7 months into my first DS role with a large corporation. I have been learning a ton including big data technologies, engineering, new software, and new languages. This has been great for my development and really improved my skills and I'm very grateful for it (and my manager!).

However, I feel as that I don't actually have any ""accomplishments"" in terms of modelling and deployment. Our company is late to the data analytics/science scene and we are running a new DS shop. We can never fully complete a project and implement anything as whatever new thing is keeping an executive up at night trumps whatever our current project is. Multiple projects have been pushed to the side in my time here even ones with actual cost savings.

For example, I was able to develop a scoring engine for my first project here that would result in 5-8m in savings a month. Our VP was excited by this number but was too uncomfortable/unfamiliar with data science and machine learning to let us implement it. We tried explaining everything to him as best as we could but to no avail. We can easily do this with docker and other tools with a little bit of help with the IT group. I'm not saying everyone is like this but it seems as though you're limiting what we were hired to do. 

So many projects come in and then get pushed off that we can't even get halfway through one of them. However, I have developed a cool ML engineering pipeline for our projects which we all use which I'm very proud of, but with regards to models and actual deployment, I have nothing.

My manager has said it takes time to get DS shops up and running in unfamiliar places but I feel like I won't have anything to show for on a resume other than the pipeline/new things I've learned (which I'm not discounting at all). I guess I'm really trying to get at the fact that we can save time/money by implement models but it's like we'll never get there.

Like I mentioned though, my mentor here has been more than great to me and what I've learned so far will benefit me for years to come. I just wish we would be able to finish out projects and get stuff implemented for the business.

Any feedback or advice from the community would be greatly appreciated!

1474,How do I compute this percentage from the available data? Is this a linear regression? Data science project.,0,fgvgij,datascience,8,"I just came up with a data science-y project idea but I need help with the math side of it.

I will take studies that have found a correlation between cannabis use in undeveloped brains and decreased cognitive capacity and for the sake of this example I will input 2 variables: average frequency of consumption and quantity consumed. I will take this through a python script and I will output a mathematical function that connects two percentages: the probability (first percentage) X% that you will be Y% less capable than the average non-smoker person in either short-term memory, attention span, etc.

The problem is I know literally no statistics so I'm kinda struggling with the math side. Is this what you'd call a linear regression? What is the actual algorithm for outputting this mathematical function? I first thought I would have to just do some sort of arithmetic mean but it got more complicated when you had more values. For example I can have this data set (a bigger sample would give more accuracy but I'm gonna give a sample of 3 so this example is easier)

Let f be the average frequency of use in days: how much days do they wait in between smoke sessions

Let q be the average quantity they consume in each session (in grams or whatever unit of measure, doesn't matter).

User 1: f = 7, q = 1

User 2: f = 14, q = 1.2

User 3: f = 3, q = 0.5

Each user will also have a variable representing how much less capable they are than the average person on a certain mental task. In reality I'm probably gonna have a list of variables for each user so I compute a separate mathematical function for each mental ability (memory, attention span, etc.) but for the sake of this example let's say they have just one more variable representing how worse they are from the average person at attention span. Let it be a.

User 1: a = 0.2 (20%)

User 2: a = 0.1

User 3: a = 0.3

Now I have to use all this data to compute a mathematical function f : S -> [0;1], S = {f, q, p | f, q are from R+, p is from [0;1] } which takes in the percentage of probability that the output is gonna happen as well as f and q and outputs the percentage decrease in attention span from the normal person (basically a). Now that I think of it, it should work in reverse too, inputting the percentage decrease and outputting the probability that will happen so this function also has to be *bijective*. Actually it's not bijective per se, because I just reverse a and p. I add a in the domain set ""S"" and take out p in the output. Anyway...

Now what I need help with is computing the larger function that takes in two variables and outputs the function f. And that larger function is fed before two *lists* of variables to have the proper data. That will be the script I will write. I'm stumped, because it's taking in three lists of variables and outputs 2. If it was just two outputting 1 it would be easier, for example:

User 1: f = 7, a = 0.3

User 2: f = 14, a = 0.1

User 3: f = 3, a = 0.5

It's way easier to do it now, having to output just a. If I input 7, 14 or 3 I know what I'm going to get. If I output anything else between 3 and 14 I just have to find out the relation between the two closest variables. From 14 to 7, f halved and a tripled. This would mean that (most likely) if f quarters then a would be multiplied by 1.5, if f is divided by 3 a would be multiplied by 4.5 etc. That's for any variable between 14 and 7. Between 3 and 7 I do the same with the other data. Is this a correct approach? Either way if you also have to add the output p besides the output a I'm stuck. Then you also add the input q and I'm even more stuck. 

So what do I have to do ?

I know how to compute derivatives and to work with matrices and determinants in case that is needed."

1476,What is the closest Python equivalent of R's dbplyr?,120,fgusho,datascience,60,"Most people who use R for data science are familiar with its [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package. [Dbplyr](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/) allows users to work with remote data stored in databases as if it was in-memory data. Basically, it translates dplyr verbs into SQL queries. Crucially, it has two enormous advantages over simply sending out SQL queries through a connection:

&#x200B;

>The most important difference between ordinary data frames and remote database queries is that your R code is translated into SQL and executed in the database, not in R. When working with databases, dplyr tries to be as lazy as possible:  
>  
>It never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it.  
>  
>It delays doing any work until the last possible moment: it collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a similar package for Python. So far, I've found two packages which do something akin to the ""verb-to-SQL"" translation of dbplyr: [Blaze](https://github.com/blaze/blaze) and [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) (I've actually found them through [this r/datascience post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7w0ap8/the_dplyr_r_package_has_an_explain_function_that/)). Blaze appears to have been more popular than Ibis, but seems to have gone almost completely stale some years ago, while Ibis is in active development. I haven't yet been able to figure out if they offer the same ""laziness"" of dbplyr, so if anyone could clear that out for me, it would be greatly appreciated. Between Blaze and Ibis, which one would you recommend? Additionally, if anyone knows of some better alternative that I haven't mentioned, please share it."

1479,When to not choose the highest accuracy model,0,fgocu7,datascience,19,"Hi all,

I've come across a small dilemma in my work while creating a churn prediction model.

So the idea is that I'm trying to perform a binary classification to predict churn (0 = churn, 1 = no churn). The model is trained on data of churned observations and non-churned observations. I've managed to build models with extensive hyper-parameter tuning that can achieve \~95-98% testing accuracy. 

The problem is that if a model is always right in this case it would be unusable - it will correctly predict all unchurned observations as unchurned, and all churned observations as churned. So to see unchurned observations at-risk of churning, a less accurate model (in terms of recall) may be more useful.

My question: Are there reasons you would pick a less accurate model outside of computation cost, and interpretability? Would it be sensible to choose a less accurate model here?"

1484,understanding propensity score matching,2,fgkfu2,datascience,16,"so my layman's term of propensity score matching is that it allows you to do an 'apples to apples' comparison.

So for example, if I have 2 groups of people:

last year: 100 of 200 people who buy,  
this year: 200 of 500 people who buy.

if I want to compare the customers from this year and last year, I can use propensity scoring and it'll match customers from this year and last year so I can do better comparison. So for example, if this year, there is a very very unique person, I may want to throw that person out for comparison.

reading the match package in R, the first step is to do a logistic regression to get the probability of buying. My confusion is that they keep referring that 'probability' to propensity.

Is propensity just another word for probability? if so, why are we matching by propensity? shouldn't we match by features? i,e race to race, gender to gender, etc.

I dont think I follow the logic of how matching by probability creates the 'apples to apples' comparison."

So for example a patient would get a diagnostic error if a doctor said they had a cold but then later it turned out they had the flu or something
 
I made a logistic regression (had an diagnostic error vs didnt have an error) and added variables such as gender,number of visits, ect with each row being a specific patient in the last 2 years or so

I chose to do a regression because after researching online, it was reccomend that I do one to hold all factors equal since the hospital was majority white like 70% 

I was explaining this project to the hiring manager and she was asking stuff about model validation and over fitting of the model. 

I'm not sure what I should have said. I think those questions, especially the one about over fitting should really have only applied if I'm trying to predict future diagnostic errors. 

I was only doing a regression to control for other demographic variables. I'm gonna be honest I didnt do much model validation because I was under the impression that that's mainly necessary for predictive modeling which this wasn't. 

What should I have said? Am I wrong and that even though this project wasn't predictive modeling, I still should have done validation?

1496,How to measure progress towards a goal for groups with different number of members?,0,fg1wxs,datascience,10,"Hello,

I am trying to come up with a fair way to measure two groups of different sizes progressing towards the same goal.  
I have Group1 with 1000 members and Group2 with 200 members. Each member has to complete a survey that will be open for 20 days. Obviously, group2 has fewer members and reaching 100% participation will take less time than group2.   
I was thinking of measuring the pace of the progress towards 100% participation rather than the actual time it takes to hit 100%. For Example: the projected pace for Group1 is 50 members/day (1000 members/20 days), while the projected pace for group2 is 10 members per day.  Who is more successful will then be determined by the actual average daily pace (number of members completing survey) as a percentage of the group's target pace. If group1 finishes in 19 days, their actual average daily pace will be 52.5 or 105% of their projected pace.   
Does this seem like a fair way to measure which group is on-track? Is there another way to ""handicap"" group2?

1501,Including percentage as predictor in logistic regression,0,ffwx9k,datascience,2,"Hi,  
I have a dataset of companies, and I know for each company what percentage of their revenue came from which region. (e.g: company A has total revenue 100K, 40K in USA, 60K in europe. Company B has 1 million revenue, 900K in USA, 100K in europe, etc..).  
I also know for each company if it is succesful or not.

I now want to see if moving from EU to USA (or vice versa) has some effect on the succes of a company. That is, so maybe companies with high revenue share in a specific region tend to be more succesful.

I was thinking of calculating the revenue % for each company and adding that as a feature. However, a logistic regression will probably just tell me that increasing USA revenue % and Europe revenue % increases likelihood of being succesful (because it increases revenue). This is of course not what we want, because we can not just increase USA revenue % without decreasing Europe %. So somehow, I can not include both in my model.

For example, instead of saying something like: 

>I built an anomaly detection model using isolation forests to identify click fraud, thus saving $100M a year

I would frame it using the STAR approach:

>Click-Fraud Detection: Online ad platforms earn revenue when users click on an affiliated ad placed in a website, sharing part of the revenue with the website owner. Fraudulent users try to subvert this model, by building automated programs that mimic a genuine click from a genuine user.  
>  
>I worked with a major Australian ad platform in developing a click-fraud detection model. I used an Isolation Forest model, leveraging features like click-velocity of user, time-of-day, User's IP etc, in order to identify a fraudulent user before they have caused too much damage.  
>  
>The model achieved a positive predictive value of 70%, resulting in savings of $100M a year.

My questions:

1. Is this too verbose a format? Some of my reasons for this format:
   1. It's easy to wrongly assume people are familiar with the problem or even the industry. In the above example, exposition about what click-fraud is seems unnecessary. That is a toy example chosen for ease of understanding. Some industries, like Finance or Healthcare, have some very dense jargon which will never make sense to someone not intimately familiar with the industry.
   2. An ML project involves a lot of steps. This lets me flesh out a very high level summary of what happened. For instance, reading what I have written, it's easy to understand what the data sort-of looked like due to the examples of the features.
2. How do I manage content overload?
   1. Due to a large number of projects, the 2 pages now look extremely wordy.
   2. I have little hope that a recruiter would take the 5 minutes necessary to read and understand my experience. Due to the verbose format, ""ML jargon-density"" is very low. My fear is that the recruiter would eye-ball the 2 pages, see very few ""keywords"" like ""Random Forest"" or ""LSTM"" and would reject the resume.

In summary, I now face a weird choice. 

If I go ahead with the STAR format, I have a resume which is easy-to-understand (at least if it's done right), but the word count is high and there's a good chance an overworked recruiter will skim and decide against going forward. 

If I go with a more one-liner approach, the keyword-density definitely increases. This means that the skimming recruiter will catch a lot of ML-specific jargon. However, it's unlikely they would really understand what the problem was and what my solution did.

I would love to hear your take on this dilemma."
1531,How do I transition from Data Analyst to Data Scientist?,0,fezb78,datascience,9,"I’ve been at my current job for about a year. My job duties look something like this: 50% Data manipulation (formatting/calculating) in SAS and MS SQL Server (sometimes I get to do ETL, but very rarely), 25% troubleshooting data anomalies (communicating with data sources), 25% building/editing Tableau dashboards. I am taking online classes on Python, and plan to take classes on R. 

I know from HR that my companies career path for my role is something like this: Associate Data Analyst —> Data Analyst —> Senior Data Analyst —> Data Scientist etc. I’ve talked to our “Senior Data Analysts” and they don’t know any R or Python or SQL, they use SAS, SPSS, VBA and Tableau only. They’re more on the BI side I think. 

We have a separate “Modeling and PA” team, and I want to make a transition to that, because that’s where the “real” data science happens, at least imo. Eventually I want to work with ML and PA myself. 

I guess my question boils down to this: besides learning R and Python (and how to use them for my purposes), as well as getting more industry knowledge, what should I do to progress my career? Should I ask for more “data sciency” projects where I can actually apply stuff I learn. 

Thanks!"
1532,Rookie advice please!,0,feyxb3,datascience,9,"Sorry for the boring post, but I’m at a critical point in my life and I feel like your advice could help me. I finish University this month (Manchester, UK) and will have a First Class Honours Degree in BSC Criminology with Quantitative Methods. I’ve consistently achieved 85% and higher across all units, and have achieved the highest results across the year in my major (statistical data analysis). I’m very confident in SPSS & Excel.

I’m currently looking for a graduate data job. I’ve applied for 5 this week and have one interview. However all of the jobs I’m looking at require competence in R, Python, PowerBI, Tableau, Stata, SQL etc etc... I’m trying to train myself in more programmes however I obviously can’t learn all of them at once.

Granted, Wiki has this information, albeit in a rather unstructured way, meaning they have paragraphs  under a heading, which may or may not exist for another destination. 

Think about  making your own TripAdvisor which gives you a lot of information about a particular destination. How would you go about collecting all that information, if you did not have the resources to hire a content team or did not want to go the 'scraping' route.

I need this information for about 1500 destinations.

1535,Classify items into nonspecific 'Other' category,2,fevs7x,datascience,6,"I have a multilabel classification problem that looks pretty straightforward but I noticed that we have a requirement to classify non-classifiable items into an 'Other' category. The data thus has been labeled with the relevant labels and then those that are unclassifiable are all 'Other'. 

I think the multilabel classification part for the classifiable labels should be straight forward, but I am wondering what I should do with the 'Other' category. Because its nothing more than a dumping ground for nonclassifiable data, its nothing I specifically want to predict against and additionally, the features would be non predictive for this label since there is nothing holding the records for this label together. 

I was thinking of excluding the 'Other' class from my training data and then if I dont see high enough probabilities for any one class, place in 'Other'

Is this a good approach? I am wondering whats the best way to proceed with this problem?"

I know some SQL, but I'm not very solid at it. I wrote my first self join with a CASE WHEN in the join condition today and felt pretty proud, but looking at some of my teammates, it's pretty obvious my SQL skill could use some improvement. As much as I love pandas, if I can do a fair amount of data-prep up front, I'd prefer that (and it keeps our DBAs employed).

One of my teammates took a SQL query that another department wrote and sped it up by an order of magnitude (45 minutes to about 4 minutes) by pulling data into four different temporary tables and joining on those. That's the sort of insight I'm looking to build.

Any recommendations on tutorials? I'm looking for some intermediate SQL resources, preferably geared toward teaching you *when* you'd want to use certain techniques. I went through [select star sql](https://selectstarsql.com/) and found it great for an introduction, but I'd really like to start making some higher-order connections."

1544,Interested in Data Science career.,14,fem75f,datascience,4,"Hey everyone! I’m a third year Industrial and Management Engineering student at RPI in Upstate NY, and was interested in potentially going into the data science/consulting industry. IE is a major that can put you in a wide variety of fields, but I was wondering how “viable” it is for an IE to go into data science? I am also going to do my Masters in Applied Math once I’m done with undergrad since it’ll only take a year and my school will allow me to keep my financial aid package during that extra year. Would you say Applied Math would be a good start to a data science career?

I have experience with Excel, Python, R, and MATLAB. I want to learn SQL and will be learning JMP this summer during an internship I have. I’m pretty bad at writing code from scratch as my first experience with coding didn’t come until my second semester of college. But I am decent at modifying code and understanding others code. How important would you say coding is in Data Science? 

My last part will be more about data science in general. Are there any skills/courses you think would be beneficial for me to take? I also really want to get into the airline/transportation industry, so would say that Data Science is common in those industries?

I'm asking because I don't understand why would people use such software when you already have a more powerful tool like Python or R, which are also free.

I guess software provides a user friendly UI (vs coding environment), and maybe a less steep learning curve, other than that I don't see the benefit of using software vs programming language.

1551,Analysis is going to bring in millions of pounds to business - Can I ask for additional compensation?,4,fed4o1,datascience,25,"Hi all,

* The context:
   * My analysis has found thousands of business opportunities which are co-funded by the government. In short, this means that the company which I am working for (start-up, capital of £5mln) is very likely to receive upwards of £12mln in funding. This is only possible because of the datasets and scripts I have developed over the past 18 months. My work allows the company to screen entire UK for projects which are eligible for government co-funding. Without it, the targeting system would be limited to ""Oh, we've heard..."" and ""Somebody told us about..."".
* The question:
   * What can I get out of it? It's brilliant that the business is going to make a bank using my work but it doesn't mean anything for me. Unless I ask for something. So what sort of appropirate compensation would be reasonable to ask for? A flat bonus? £100 per successfully co-funded project (Average project brings in £200,000 in funding so £100 would be 0.5%) or something else altogether?"

Hi everyone! My first post on here!

I hope I made the question clear somehow, sorry if my wording is messy!

I have always had quite a hard time understanding the order of chromosomes, certain terms associated with them, what part belongs to whom, etc.

For example, I know we have 46 chromosomes in our cells, except in our gametes whereas there are 23 due to meiosis. 23 egg chromosomes + 23 sperm chromosomes = 46 chromosomes in our body's cells. Chromatids are the halves joined together by the centromere which then looks like the chromosome linked above.

My question is, where do those chromatids come from exactly - as in from what parent? Do they come from one person - as in the one chromatid is the template and the other is the copy? Is one chromatid of the same chromosome from the mom and the other from the dad?

I hope I made this somewhat understandable! If anyone wants me to elaborate some more let me know! Thanks in advance.

Note: To my knowledge, the chromosome linked above is what it looks like during the metaphase of mitosis/meiosis 1. If that's incorrect, please let me know!"

Different instruments have these harmonics at different volumes and that is the reason why instruments sound different from each other. So as you can see, this question isn't ""what are harmonics/ what is the harmonic series"" but rather, *why* do they exist in nature?

&#x200B;

The confusing part to me is this: synthesizers take pure frequencies, such as sine waves, square or triangle waves. These frequencies have no harmonics, they are the naked fundamental. So, how is it possible that we can make man-made sounds that don't have harmonics, but there isn't a single natural-made sound that doesn't? I guess because pure sine/square/triangle waves would have to exist in the natural universe, and they simply don't? If they don't exist naturally, how are we getting them in our synths? Surely something is causing the wave, and so wouldn't we say whatever that thing is (electricity, I guess?) doesn't have harmonics? Thanks!"

Her argument was that the probabilities of #1 and #2 are identical because they are independent events. (Haven’t taken prob stats so honestly I know little about that)

My argument was that #2 had a higher probability because if you were to find an analogy in just rolling 1 die:
What is the probability of rolling 1? 1/6 easy.
What is the probability of rolling 1 or 2? 2/6?
1, 2, or 3? 3/6?

I'm currently in the process of rendering my hard drives unreadable by taking them apart and physically destroying the platters.  I have a few questions, however.  A post I read recently suggested that the pcb and/or other hard drive components can also contain private info, making it important to destroy the entire hard drive (minus the case).

1. Is this true, or is simply killing the platter enough?
2. Are hard drives the ONLY source of personal info storage on a computer, or do I have do something with the Motherboard or other parts?
3. If I DO have to destroy more than the hard drive platters, how do I do so safely, as I understand there are a lot of toxic chemicals inside computers and am concerned about health risks (breathing things in).

Thank you so much for your time!"

I understand that there are many young politicians at the lower levels (i.e. mayors, city council members, etc.). But positions like the U.S. Presidency are very old, with even the few ""youngsters"" like Kennedy in his mid-40s. Why is that? The average voter cares much more about charisma and relatability and less about ""old-grandpa wisdom"", which parallels the universal societal perception that younger = sexier. The average voter also isn't an old person, so again, less reason to vote for old guys into high office."
