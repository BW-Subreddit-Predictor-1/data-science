Hi everyone! My first post on here!

I hope I made the question clear somehow, sorry if my wording is messy!

I have always had quite a hard time understanding the order of chromosomes, certain terms associated with them, what part belongs to whom, etc.

For example, I know we have 46 chromosomes in our cells, except in our gametes whereas there are 23 due to meiosis. 23 egg chromosomes + 23 sperm chromosomes = 46 chromosomes in our body's cells. Chromatids are the halves joined together by the centromere which then looks like the chromosome linked above.

My question is, where do those chromatids come from exactly - as in from what parent? Do they come from one person - as in the one chromatid is the template and the other is the copy? Is one chromatid of the same chromosome from the mom and the other from the dad?

I hope I made this somewhat understandable! If anyone wants me to elaborate some more let me know! Thanks in advance.

Note: To my knowledge, the chromosome linked above is what it looks like during the metaphase of mitosis/meiosis 1. If that's incorrect, please let me know!"

Even though we can make music with pure frequencies?,6,hb61zt,explainlikeimfive,11,"I know what the harmonic series is, and I know that it exists in nature - basically every sound has a fundamental frequency, and a bunch of higher notes we call harmonics. Different instruments have these harmonics at different volumes and that is the reason why instruments sound different from each other. So as you can see, this question isn't ""what are harmonics/ what is the harmonic series"" but rather, *why* do they exist in nature?

&#x200B;

The confusing part to me is this: synthesizers take pure frequencies, such as sine waves, square or triangle waves. These frequencies have no harmonics, they are the naked fundamental. So, how is it possible that we can make man-made sounds that don't have harmonics, but there isn't a single natural-made sound that doesn't? I guess because pure sine/square/triangle waves would have to exist in the natural universe, and they simply don't? If they don't exist naturally, how are we getting them in our synths? Surely something is causing the wave, and so wouldn't we say whatever that thing is (electricity, I guess?) doesn't have harmonics? Thanks!"

2. What is the probability of rolling the dice and getting 1:1:1 or 2:2:2 or 3:3:3 or 4:4:4 or 5:5:5 or 6:6:6?

Her argument was that the probabilities of #1 and #2 are identical because they are independent events. (Haven’t taken prob stats so honestly I know little about that)

My argument was that #2 had a higher probability because if you were to find an analogy in just rolling 1 die:
What is the probability of rolling 1? 1/6 easy.
What is the probability of rolling 1 or 2? 2/6?
1, 2, or 3? 3/6?
1,2,3,4? 4/6?
1,2,3,4,5? 5/6?
And of course 1,2,3,4,5,6... 6/6.

I genuinely don’t know which is right, or if either are right. Edit: also I don’t know why I included statistics in the title, other than the fact that it’s been ingrained in my head since I was young that prob stats just go together"

I'm currently in the process of rendering my hard drives unreadable by taking them apart and physically destroying the platters.  I have a few questions, however.  A post I read recently suggested that the pcb and/or other hard drive components can also contain private info, making it important to destroy the entire hard drive (minus the case).

1. Is this true, or is simply killing the platter enough?
2. Are hard drives the ONLY source of personal info storage on a computer, or do I have do something with the Motherboard or other parts?
3. If I DO have to destroy more than the hard drive platters, how do I do so safely, as I understand there are a lot of toxic chemicals inside computers and am concerned about health risks (breathing things in).

Thank you so much for your time!"

"ELI5: Why are the top elected politicians, on average, over middle age?",1,h91ctj,explainlikeimfive,12,"I just can't understand why. I understand how dictators can tend to be of an older age -- more experience, more connections tend to make it easier to grab power without necessarily having the people like you. I understand that there are many young politicians at the lower levels (i.e. mayors, city council members, etc.). But positions like the U.S. Presidency are very old, with even the few ""youngsters"" like Kennedy in his mid-40s. Why is that? The average voter cares much more about charisma and relatability and less about ""old-grandpa wisdom"", which parallels the universal societal perception that younger = sexier. The average voter also isn't an old person, so again, less reason to vote for old guys into high office."
