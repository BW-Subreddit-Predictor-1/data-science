Do we know of any diseases dinosaurs could have been infected with?,2,hcxfcd,askscience,0,"I get that paleontology doesn't get much in the way of soft tissue or the ability to look at micro organisms, but I thought I'd ask.

Maybe some of the same diseases that birds get today?"
Do all animals have an internal compass? How does it work? How come humans don't have this ability?,4,hcqbk1,askscience,3,Always wondered how birds and fish never got lost whike migrating. Anyone know why?
Does a plane have to slow down after dropping a payload?,1,hcplk2,askscience,4,"If a plane drops a heavy payload while in flight (nuclear bomb? idk), wouldn't a sudden imbalance in the forces propel the plane up suddenly? Then does the plane have to decelerate suddenly?"
What causes the rotational speeds of planets to differ so greatly?,3,hcpqvw,askscience,7,"I noticed that the rotational speeds of planets vary greatly as they get further from the Sun. Venus takes 243 days to complete one rotation while Jupiter only takes 9 hours. 

What are the factors that influence rotational speed of planets and why does it differ so much between the inner planets and the outer planets?"
"We have active cancer cells in labs that have been grown since the 50s and don't experience senescence, would it be possible to utilise this 'immortality' to grow organs?",3,hcpzjo,askscience,12,

Do organs ever get re-donated?,6343,hco00a,askscience,305,"Basically, if an organ transplant recipient dies, can the transplanted organ be used by a third person?"
What is the mechanism behind the rate of Radioactive Decay?,48,hcntrj,askscience,38," 

I was taught that after one half-life period, one half of the initial mass will break down. But when I asked why doesn’t it consistently decays, meaning after 2 half-lives, all of the matter will be gone, my teacher didn't give an appropriate answer and I had to take that for granted.

What is the mechanism behind Radioactive decay that makes it works that way? Why does the presence of more radioactive matter causes more atoms to decay?"
"What is a ""Cardiac filament""?",2,hc9mgn,askscience,2,"I was reading a bit in the famous *Gray’s Anatomy* about some functions of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve’s unusually long pathway. One section says:  “As the recurrent laryngeal nerve curves around the subclavian artery or the arch of aorta, it gives several cardiac filaments to the deep part of the cardiac plexus (*Gray's Anatomy*, 1980, p. 1081). I've tried to find out what exactly that means, but I'm struggling to understand what ""cardiac filaments"" are. Any help would be most appreciated."
What causes shingles (and the zoster virus in general) to manifest as a rash?,20,hcmje5,askscience,15,"Shingles is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. In searching online, I haven’t been able to find out what triggers the virus to exhibit a painful rash with blisters. Why is it a rash instead of, say, a sore throat?"

Why are smartphones cameras so small?,3,hcbneu,askscience,2,"As I understand, the bigger the sensor, the more light goes in and the better a image is. So, why must smartphone cameras be so small? There is plenty of space on the back"
How does the standard model of particle physics explain Newton's laws of motion?,50,hckfpk,askscience,8,"The way I understand it, the standard model of particle physics describes four fundamental interactions: electromagnetism, gravity, the strong force, and the weak nuclear force, gravity being unexplained in specific terms. Where then does Newton's ""F"" in F=ma come from (in particular the ""applied force""), and why does it act upon aggregates of particles according to the Newtonian laws of motion?"
Can an individual be continuously reinfected by a virus?,12,hce1i7,askscience,10,"For example, if I have a bad cold and am sitting in my room all day retouching the same objects over and over, am I continuously reinfecting myself (or ""erasing"" my body's progress of fighting it) by taking in more of the virus?"
Are the chances of multiple vaccine prospects for COVID-19 working correlated or independent?,1,hcegwr,askscience,3,"The NY Times is tracking the number of COVID-19 vaccines in each phase of human trials. If one of these vaccines fails does that mean others are more likely to fail as well, perhaps due to some underlying trait of the disease, or are these independent rolls of the dice? Do we get more information from a failed trial about if other vaccine prospects are likely to work?"
How can someone be asymptomatic when having COVID-19?,1,hceofy,askscience,4,A detailed explanation...
"Assuming that coronavirus antibodies only last for a few months, what would this mean for immunity?",1,hcfngt,askscience,6,There was an article in r/science that said that there is evidence that COVID antibodies may only last for two to three months. Does this mean that your immunity would end after that time period if you had already caught the virus? Does that mean a potential vaccine would only be effective for a few months? How will this affect attempts to eliminate the virus in the future?
If 0’C = 32’F then does 0+0=64?,0,hcj5ct,askscience,10,
Do creatures with shorter lifespans evolve faster?,51,hccfcn,askscience,22,"Maybe I'm wrong with this but my (very) basic understanding of evolution is that there are genetic mutations in a species that ""win"" over vast amounts of time and change things as a result. So, if you have certain creatures that only live a few years, then wouldn't any mutations happen faster if they were far more generations to travel through?"
Why is there a high tide in the opposite side to the moon?,11,hc8cok,askscience,17,"It makes sense why there would be a high tide facing the moon, because the moon's gravity pulls the water. But why a high tide on the opposite tide, therefore 2 high tides a day?"
"Which is more efficient, high or low altitude flight?",14,hc3myj,askscience,9,"I know nothing about this but I was just considering air density and flight. I think low altitude has higher density air which would make more friction on a fuselage and slow an aircraft down BUT the engines would have more thrust/material to push. In very high altitude there would be less friction but also less air/material for the engines to push so they might have to work harder to go the same speed? I suspect that it might depend on what speed an aircraft wants to go. Also, getting to altitude might remove any efficiency advantage of high altitude flight.  Think Solar Impulse versus the X-15. Which is more efficient, very high or very low fight?"
"Can someone who has had Covid-19, and built up immunity, still spread the virus via respiratory droplets?",0,hc5npl,askscience,9,Let’s say you get exposed again after building immunity. Is there a period where the virus is able to spread before your immune system can kill it?
"Is carrying antibiotic resistance genes costly for bacteria? In other words, is there any selection pressure against having them?",15,hc73fp,askscience,12,
What exactly is the lymphatic system for and what are it’s evolutionary origins?,32,hc75oc,askscience,13,"I’ve always learned answers such as “it’s important for the immune system” and also that it aids in fat transport. However, it seems excessive to have a separate vessel system just for those purposes, when the circulatory system is generally adequate for most immune response and nutrient circulation. How did the lymphatic system evolve and remain present? Did it once hold greater importance? How bad would it be if someone didn’t have it?"
"If something bleaches, where does the colour go?",35,hc22md,askscience,9,"When something gets bleached, where does the colour go?
For example plastic toys or printed posters that lose their colour when exposed to the sun, as well as chemical bleached things such as hair or fabrics."
"How does the doppler effect not violate conservation of momentum? Is this a dark energy, negative vacuum pressure thing?",6,hc2flc,askscience,5,"Not a physics major.  Just watch a lot of Matt O'Dowd(👍).

Photon momentum is a function of frequency.  If a photon's 
frequency is different between two observers in receding galaxies, where did that momentum energy go?

Does it bleed into some fundamental field?
Does dark energy's stretching of spacetime warp the waveform?
Does it mean there really is a prime reference frame and photon energies are only observed to be different because of relativistic Doppler effects?"
Are there gemstones on the moon?,6399,hc06f9,askscience,408,"From my understanding, gemstones on Earth form from high pressure/temperature interactions of a variety of minerals, and in many cases water.

&#x200B;

I know the Moon used to be volcanic, and most theories describe it breaking off of Earth after a collision with a Mars-sized object, so I reckon it's made of more or less the same stuff as Earth. Could there be lunar Kimberlite pipes full of diamonds, or seams of metamorphic Tanzanite buried in the Maria?

How much did fishes adapt to fishing?,226,hby8jr,askscience,43,"We as humans practice fishing for a very long time, and very intensively recently, so I wonder how can fishes still got tricked by the hooks and baits (even though most of fishing today is not with that method) So, are there fish species that significantly changed their behavior in response to fishing? And which one?"
How fast could you go if you built a railgun straight through the Moon?,2,hbw3v9,askscience,7,If the Moon is 3500Km’s across and assuming that you had 200Gw available (1Gw nuclear plant every 100Kms with efficiency losses) and 1 ton of mass? How does this change at a limited acceleration of 10g? I think that you would get to a decent percentage of c but I don’t know what this would be.
can space really be called a vacuume?,4,hbxwk9,askscience,5,If i'm understanding solar wind correctly space shouldn't be considered a true vacuum right? what am i missing here?
How did covid-19 enter the first person to infect them?,1,hbtvul,askscience,5,"From what’s all understanding I have, it would be unlikely that the first case was from someone eating a bat.  Is it that maybe it comes from something else they had eaten that was infected?"
Does docking with the international space station affect its orbit?,7,hblbz3,askscience,4,I would imagine it would have to - what I'm really curious about is whether or not it is enough of an impact that an adjustment has to be made after docking in order to keep the ISS in a stable orbit
What mediates a salmon's ability to return to it's home river?,37,hbth40,askscience,16,"Is the instinct to return to their home river encoded in their DNA, or in their early memories? For example, if I took salmon eggs laid in river A and transplanted them in river B, which river would they return to?"
Does the engine placement on a plane affect how steep the plane can take off?,8,hbss0g,askscience,9,"I know there are a lot of factors involved in this such as the wind, weight of the plane, and the design of the plane itself but imagine two planes, one with engines on the tail (MD-80 series) vs. one with engines on the wings (737s or A320s), taking off at an identical takeoff situation. Which plane might be able to take off at a steeper angle?"
"Questions on Newton's 3rd law: when I push on a wall, how does it push back on me? I just don't understand what is happening at the particle level when push a wall thar causes it to push back on me.

"Since heat transfer is caused by random collision of particles, is it mathematically possible that your hand could touch a hot pan and you actually heat up the pan with your hand?",24,hbkera,askscience,20,"I know the probability of this would be inconceivably small so it would never actually happen, but is it mathematically possible that: because heat transfer is based on random collisions of particles, all the hot particles just so happen to bounce from your hand to a hot so that the net heat transfer is positive? This would mean that instead of the pan heating up your hand, your hand transfers even more heat to the pan.

Sorry if I'm misunderstanding physics, just a fun question I thought of."

Why are Irradiated Objects Radioactive for so Long??,8,hbefvq,askscience,4,"I’m watching the Chernobyl docuseries for the first time and am not fully grasping the concept of radiation exposure. 

It seems that a lot of the land around Chernobyl has seen reduced radiation over time to where tourists can come and visit the area (for limited periods of time). 

But the Pripyat Hospital basement is still incredibly dangerous from the piles of engineer and fireman clothes who were working that night some 30+ years ago. 

There are even videos on YouTube - https://youtu.be/pzjtJNu-jYM - of people touring the basement with Geiger counters, showing the radiation being emitted from those items. 

Please explain to me like I’m a 6 year old:

- Why/how do irradiated objects then themselves emit their own radiation? (if that is even what is happening)
- Why are objects/soil on the surface (that were in close proximity to the core explosion) seemingly “safer” 30+ years later, while worker’s clothes are still dangerous?
- Is there a simple way to explain radiation and its effects in high doses (more so on objects than people)?

Thank you."
"If gravity propagates non-instantly, does that mean planets are being pulled to where the sun *was* a small time ago?",21,hbfqlc,askscience,10,"If so, since the sun is moving extremely quickly through the galaxy, why doesn’t it eventually lose its planets as they’re in a sense being attracted to a point pretty far “behind” where it currently is?"
"Are there any ""living clades"" (2 or more species whose last common ancestor is not extinct)?",20,hbd7cz,askscience,6,"I can't think of any... it could happen, right?

Oh and ""living clade"" is apparently a meaninglyes term that I've just made up, which is probably why I can't google it! And maybe I'm using it wrong anyway, unless I'm also going to insist that ALL the descendents of the last common ancestor are still with us. I would settle for any pair of distinct species who share a common ancestor that is not extinct."
Why is it easier to hold your balance on a bicycle going fast than a bicycle going slowly?,7,hbgnw0,askscience,11,"When you are going a down a hill - you gain a lot of momentum, why is it that when in a state of higher momentum the chances of you falling off are considerably less because it’s much easier to hold your balance than it is going at a slower pace: why is this?"
When does a human become capable of recognizing their own reflection?,59,hbgzjc,askscience,17,"As the question suggests, I’m just curious on how and when a person starts to recognize themselves in a mirror, and how does it compare to animals, for example?"
"Crows are all over the world, but where are crows naturally from and what kind of effect did they have as an invasive species?",7977,hbfxg7,askscience,877,"A short time ago I saw an eagle flying around and I was in awe of it's beauty because it's such a rare sight here, but then a murder of crows started chasing after him and eventually wore him out and got him. 

Then I started to wonder how eagles even exist if 6 crowd can so easily take one down, and there are so many crows around.

I think I heard once that ravens are originally from Northern America and that they've been spiritual animals for some Native American cultures, but I could be wrong about that. 

So could it be that crows have only been in Europe and Asia for a couple hundreds of years? If so, how devastating was their arrival to the local bird population and other animals?"

Is there any way to know what the Earth's rotational speed might have been prior to the collision with Theia that is theorized to have formed the Moon? And is there any chance the Earth ever experienced tidal locking/synchronous rotation with the Sun?,16,hb1tdt,askscience,6,I've seen writing that suggests that the Theia may have significantly increased the speed of the earth's rotation. Is there any chance that the Earth was ever tidally locked to the Sun before that collision?  Do models of the collision include an ability to estimate the earth's angular velocity prior to impact?
Is there a minimum or maximum limit to the wavelength of gravitational waves? What kind of gravitational interactions could these correspond to?,3,hayjot,askscience,3,
"When was the concept of ""zero gravity"" in space discovered, and was it immediately related to mass?",9,haval7,askscience,15,"Perhaps this is a melding of r/askscience and r/askhistory, but I was curious when the concept of Zero-G, or microgravity, came to be discovered or understood, and whether it was immediately correlated with the presence of mass."
What's the Difference Between Receptors and Transporters?,2,hav2ck,askscience,3,"I've been looking into the mechanism of actions of psychiatric medication and have found they primarily affect neurotransmitter transporters such as DAT, NET, and SERT. I've also found some psychiatric medication affect serotonin receptors like 5-HT1, adrenergic receptors, and dopamine receptors like D2 and D3.

Why is random noise incompressible?,3,hasgml,askscience,23,"I was looking up whether it is possible to have an incompressible sequence. I came across this post in which people are saying that random noise is incompressible: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9185289/uncompressable-data-sequence

&nbsp;

However, if I came up with a random sequence of numbers I would be able to encode the data in fewer bits by recognising patterns in the data, say multiple 1s or 0s in a row. My compression algorithm could record this section of data as 'n' number of zeros, instead of writing them all out."
"How do we determine the ""handedness"" of a race track?",3,haqy7s,askscience,4,"When going out for a bike ride on the roads, it's usually better to pick a clockwise loop to minimize the number of left-hand turns. However, riding my bike on the local F1 track ([Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve)) got me wondering how we would determine the handedness of a closed loop like a racetrack. Is it about the number of turns? About how long you go in a given direction? I would assume that this is greatly affected if the race track crosses itself too?"
Would a satellite in high earth orbit eventually crash into Earth due to the Moon affecting its orbit?,3,hap0i4,askscience,7,"Assuming we send a satelite in a high Earth circular orbit, like 50/50 between Earth and the Moon (let's assume the apoapsis is on the closest approach to the Moon, to make describing easier) . 

The satellite will be accelerated prograde and radial out, when it's on the way to its apoapsis. This would raise the apoapsis (and the periapsis slightly, due to increased velocity?), but also accelerate retrograde and radial out, when the satelite passed the apoapsis (which would lower the periapsis again?). So the net energy wouldn't change, but due to the radial out acceleration, the orbit will have a slight bulge on the Moon side and therfore a lower periapsis. 

Would this effect increase with each orbit, resulting in the satelite crashing into Earth again (while slightly rotating the apoapsis with the Moon's orbit) ?

Or would the apoapsis and periapsis stay the same and the elliptic orbit just rotates around with the Moon?

TL:DR basically the question in the title"
How quickly does a person infected with a virus become infectious themselves?,27,hb1t5i,askscience,9,"Current times got me thinking... If there were a stadium with 50,000 people in attendance for 2 hours and one of them had a virus and was infectious, presumably that person would infect a number of people around them. But how quickly would those newly infected people become infectious themselves? By the end of the 2 hours, how many of the 50,000 would we expect to be infected?"
How does sonar work?,7,hb1kz6,askscience,14,"I get that sonar is a device that emits sound waves and then collects their reflection and records the time taken in order to calculate the distance an object is from the source, but how does the device ensure that it will collect the sound wave upon reflection. For example if there was a smooth plane in front of the emitter, only a couple sound waves would return to the emitter upon reflection. Also how does a sonar distinguish one emitted wave from another?"
How do almost extinct species revive without the damaging effects of inbreeding?,6045,hayior,askscience,429,"I've heard a few stories about how some species have been brought back to vibrancy despite the population of the species being very low, sometimes down to the double digits. If the number of remaining animals in a species decreases to these dramatically low numbers, how do scientists prevent the very small remaining gene pool from being damaged by inbreeding when revitalizing the population?"
When ice is melting on thin water why does it rotate slowly?,11,hauyz4,askscience,6,"Example is here: [link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBiwatuFW9R/?igshid=ii0og8kd7i77)

For some reason, it just doesn't sit still while melting, and something causes it to spin ever so slowly."

How does a polarizing light microscope work?,3,haxr6x,askscience,2,I understand how the polarization works. I’m more confused on the ordinary/extraordinary waves that are produced after the plane polarized light passes through the material. (Side question: I still can’t wrap my head around isotropy/anisotropy if someone could also explain that.) I don’t understand how the second polar causes the extra/ordinary waves to create the vibrant colors in PLM or how rotating the stage causes the visible wavelength to cycle. Thank you in advance.
Did the nuclear bomb (testing) and the subsequent increase in background radiation levels lead to an increase in cancer?,11,hax8eu,askscience,18,"I found out today that some experiments require low-background steel, i.e. steel forged before the nuclear bomb, as steel forged after this period is contaminated with airborne radionuclides.   This led me to wonder whether the increase in background radiation had an appreciable effect on cancer rates in the global population, but I couldn't find any information on this."

Does severity of infection affect a person’s ability to donate convalescent plasma?,2,havc28,askscience,3,"I’ve just had a serological antibody test performed by my workplace for SARS-COV-2, despite never having shown symptoms for the illness. I had hoped to be able to donate plasma if I came up as positive, however in reading the donation guidelines for convalescent plasma however the criteria specifically state they require the donor to ‘have fully recovered from the infection and have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.’

I think I’m mostly getting hung up on the verbiage used but wanted to confirm: Does presence of antibodies in plasma itself act as confirmation that a person has experienced an infection?  If so, does the severity of that infection somehow affect the efficacy of donor plasma?"

Why do planetary gears rations not seem to follow the normal rear reduction rules?,0,hairfo,askscience,5,"No idea if this is the correct sub for this but I figure it cant hurt to ask.  I'm pretty good with physics and science IMO and I figured for fun I'd try to teach myself about planetary gearboxes because they're pretty cool and a bit more complicated than regular gears.

So I 3D printed a little gear I made with a 60 tooth ring gear, with a 30 tooth sun gear and two 15 tooth planet gears.  When you do the math for this particular gearbox (using equations I found online), it says for one full rotation of the sun gear, the planets should move about 1/3 of the way around the circle, essentially a 3:1 reduction, and this is how it works with the model I printed; but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around where the 3 comes from.

I would think that if I spin the sun gear one full rotation (30 teeth) it would force the planets to also spin a distance of 30 teeth, or half way around the circle.  But when you look up close you can see that with one full rotation of the sun gear, 20 teeth mesh between the sun and the planet, getting us the 20/60 or 1/3 rotation that the equations predict.  So obviously the math is right and I am just visualizing it wrong.  I can see if I instead twist the ring and watch the center gear it will twist twice to the outer gears one turn, which makes sense in my head for the two to one.  So really what still doesn't make sense is where the 3 to 1 comes from when you hold the ring gear stationary and drive the sun.  Can anyone explain why its not working the way my head seems to think it should work? Or is this there a better sub to ask?

Can a linear dynamical system undergo a Hopf bifurcation?,10,h7ruvz,askscience,7,"Another way to state the question: Can Hopf bifurcations exist without limit cycles?

Conceptually I always see a Hopf bifurcation as having two main features: loss of stability of a fixed point and either the generation or loss of a limit cycle (stable/unstable for the sub/supercritical cases respectively).

However, I usually see the Hopf bifurcation formally defined as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis.

This formal definition suggests a linear system such as z'=(a+i)z (where z is complex) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at a=0.

However, linear systems cannot have limit cycles. Is the existence of a limit cycle required for a Hopf bifurcation? And if not, is the process of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis a sufficient condition to guarantee the presence of a limit cycle in a nonlinear system (i.e. can you have nonlinear systems which undergo a Hopf without the presence of a limit cycle, and if so why do we almost always see Hopf bifurcations alongside limit cycles)?

My go to book for this type of thing is Kuznetsov's Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory, which does address this linear case (Remark 4 in section 3.4), but I struggled to get a straight answer as to whether or not the linear case can actually be defined to undergo a Hopf bifurcation.

I initially thought it was a question of ""density"" but later read that if the Sun were replaced by a Black Hole of the same mass, then nothing would change in the Solar System, in terms of orbit and otherwise. So if density is out of the equation, considering the Black Hole example, and the larger star is more massive, shouldn't the distortion also occur in the shape of the Red Dwarf?"

"AskScience AMA Series: We are the NASA New Horizons team, here to answer your questions about the New Horizons spacecraft, parallax imaging, deep space exploration and what we learned at Pluto. Ask us anything!",4670,h7imbw,askscience,474,"Join us at today at 1 p.m. ET (17 UT) to ask anything about NASA's New Horizons mission! In July 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to explore Pluto and its moons. Recently, the spacecraft - which is more than four billion miles from home and speeding toward interstellar space - took images of the stars Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 from its unique vantage point in deep space. Scientists combined these images with pictures of the same stars taken near the same time from Earth, creating stereo images that instantly demonstrate the parallax effect astronomers have long used to measure distances to stars. New Horizons is humankind's farthest photographer, imaging an alien sky. Why does New Horizons ""see"" these stars in a different place in the sky than on Earth? How are these images sent back from New Horizons? How long does it take the team on the ground to send commands to the spacecraft? Where is New Horizons headed next?

Does past exposure to viruses impact the ability to fight a new virus?,2,h7c1hp,askscience,3,"Does the body's prior immunity and history of fighting previously encountered viruses have an affect on a person's ability to fight a newly encountered virus?

Lighting a fire on jupiter?,27,h1840d,askscience,33,"So in past forums of this question, ""if you lit a flame on Jupiter, would it cause a massive fire/would Jupiter ignite or would there be a large fire at least"", the responses have always been that nothing would happen because jupiter doesn't have oxygen to support a flame.

However, from what I can see reading around, it seems like there is oxygen on Jupiter. Albeit a lot less than hydrogen, but in similar amounts to a lot of the other gasses ( [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063302001447?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032063302001447?via%3Dihub) ).

Can somebody explain how a COVID test's efficacy depends on the infection's prevalence?,2,h12yvo,askscience,4,"This article [in New York Magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/how-accurate-are-covid-19-tests.html) states that the efficacy of a COVID test (presumably any test detecting a disease) depends on how many people in the population are actually infected with it.

>Tests producing so few false positives may sound promising, but any test’s efficacy is dependent upon its accuracy and the prevalence of the disease in the population — **the lower the prevalence, the greater the chance is that a test result will be wrong. For example, if only 5 percent of the country’s population has been infected over the past three months, a test kit that is 95 percent specific will produce five true positives and five false positives,** meaning any result has only a 50 percent chance of being accurate. In that scenario, even a test with 99 percent specificity would produce false positives 17 percent of the time.

I'm having trouble understanding this concept.  Isn't the accuracy of a test simply a ratio of the estimated number of likely false results to the total number of tests given?  How can a test's accuracy vary with the factual probability of the outcome being tested?

Sorry if I'm being thick.

"What is the current, up-to-date recommendations regarding wearing face masks? Do they protect the wearer against catching COVID-19?",9,h14x9b,askscience,17,"There has been a lot of conflicting information in the media and literature regarding face masks protecting against COVID-19. I live in Canada for reference and our Chief Medical Officer at first actually advised against face masks because they were not effective against the virus. Then they said to wear them if it gives you some psychological comfort. Then they started explicitly recommending them in cases where physical distancing is not possible. Now they're making them mandatory on public transit.  

What gives? I've heard that masks apparently protect you from spreading the virus but does not protect you from catching it. But I've also read that it gives you some, but not full protection. But some is better than nothing, right?  

So what is the true answer?"

Do (urban) magpies have a special call to warn about predators?,5,h0vth8,askscience,4,"Context: I spend a lot of time on my balcony so I am constantly paying attention to the environment around me. There are lots of magpies that I usually notice only visually until yesterday when I heard a song that I couldn’t recognize. 

I looked under the tree they were sitting and there was a cat (common known urban predator for birds) and 3-4 magpies were having the same loud call (that sounded rather alarming) and were following the cat (flying from tree to tree while issuing the same call). 

As soon as the cat disappeared and ran behind bushes (probably out of sight for them) the call stopped. I normally don’t see cats roaming free on the street so I am pretty sure the magpies were trying to warn their fellas about it. 

Can anyone tell me more about this subject or am I just getting crazy for listening too much to birds and their songs? 😅"

I realise I may have incorrectly assumed that this reaction is instinctual rather than learned.

I suppose it's probably limited to primates in general if it exists at all in other species. I just found it interesting because it's an extremely specific adaptation. Unlike having a reaction to intense heat to withdraw a limb, which any animal can do, it requires having the physiology and dexterity before the adaptation becomes advantageous."

How to get a Lagrangian when there are constraint forces that do work?,1,h10x5d,askscience,4,"Say you have a spring-mass system that has a rest length of 0 and is confined to a rod that rotates at a fixed angular frequency w.

"What is the role of coordinate acceleration in general relativity, and how does gravity cause it?",1,h0ndul,askscience,1,"I have been reading material on the Equivalence Principle and General Relativity where an oft mentioned point is that accelerometers don't measure any downward acceleration on objects in free fall *because* gravity is a fictitious force which can be made to disappear in freely falling reference frame. I think all of this makes sense but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_acceleration) says something about accelerometers only measuring *proper acceleration*, and gravity is responsible for *coordinate acceleration*. Is proper acceleration only caused by actual physical forces? Then what causes coordinate acceleration, and why/how does gravity cause it?

Also, since GTR tells us that objects in regions of curved spacetime move along curved paths (geodesics), would that count as acceleration? (Since the object's direction is changing even if velocity is constant similar to an object in uniform circular motion). If yes, then is Newtonian Gravity actually trying to explain that ""acceleration"" using a ""force"" because non-Euclidean geometries and curved space, let alone spacetime as concepts didn't exist back then?"

How does armor penetration work?,3,h0iega,askscience,5,"I'm a fan of both sci fi and military history (especially tank warfare) but something that has always eluded me is the relationships between projectile mass and velocity on armor penetration.

Example
Lets take the famous .50 BMG sniper rifle round. Basic research gave me the following: (subject to variance depending on round type)

Mass: 45 g 
Muzzle Velocity: 900 m/s
Penetration: roughly 30 mm rolled homogenous armor (RHA) at close range 90 degree impact. Thats over an inch of steel in freedom units so not too shabby!

What would the RHA penetration be in the following scenarios holding all else constant?

A) Double bullet mass (90 g and 900 m/s)
B) Double bullet velocity (45 g and 1800 m/s)

These scenarios both double the momentum but only A doubles the energy, so heres a bonus:

C) Double energy thru velocity (45 g  and 1273 m/s)

Final points:
For A, I'm assuming the way you go about doubling the bullet mass matters. How would a bullet with double the density fare against one thats simply twice as long?

Also I am aware that modern propellants cant get a bullet to 1800 m/s. That being said, magnetic railguns or new plasma/liquid propellents could which makes it interesting to consider.

The Big Bang: why don’t atoms fly apart?,1,h0isnu,askscience,4,"Hi all. I read recently that the Big Bang is often misunderstood by laypeople and that it’s not an explosion of matter outwards, but instead an expansion of the universe itself. Accordingly, there is no geographic “middle” as everything in space-time is expanding.

If that’s the case (and please correct me if not), why does this not also occur at the atomic and subatomic level? For example, why does the space within an atom not also expand to the point where the forces holding the atom together are no longer effective, resulting in atoms decaying into their constituent subatomic particles?"
What is a (long term) memory?,3,h0lcyn,askscience,2,"I had a discussion about what a memory, or a long term memory, is exactly, and my friend said that a long term memory is a cell, or the neuron (paraphrasing, she's a scientist, so she used a bit more complicated words than I know), where as I said that the memory is the ""electrical firing"" between the neurons, and said that a point to this is that if someone has their brain ""shocked"", and suffer total amnesia, it's not that the neurons are damaged, but that they're ""reset"" in a way, where they ""forget"" the electrical firing for those memories.

Now, I'm open to the fact that I'm wrong, but I'm also not just gonna subjugate to authority and blindly accept what she said, and her explanation for why she was right was very entitled and more of a ""listen to me, kid"", which made me lock up even more.

Now, with the loose explanation I gave, can you guys confirm who was right?

How did Newtonian gravity and general relativity's predictions of the bending of light due to gravity differ?,6,gznpy6,askscience,5,"Like general relativity, Newtonian gravity predicts that the presence of the sun will bend star light (according to [this Vox video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLxvq_M4218)),  so that when observing stars around the sun during an eclipse, you will  observe some displacement. General relativity predicts a different  amount of displacement, hence the famous photo proving Einstein's  theory. Why did the two theories predict different amounts of  displacement?"

Atomspheric lapse rate applied to solids?,0,gzlig6,askscience,14,"The lapse rate which is proportional to g/cp (gravity/ heat capacity) means that the higher you go up in the atmosphere, the cooler it gets. Think white snow capped mountains.

Does this lapse rate formula also apply to solids and explains why it gets hot down the bottom of mines?

Looking at the wikipedia article and derivation there doesn’t seem to be anything particular to gases.

[Wikipedia Lapse Rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate?wprov=sfti1) 

Applying the lapse rate formula -9.8/Cp to a deep gold mine gives a similar result.

-9.8/800*4000m= 49oC temperature rise

800 is rough Cp for rock
4000m Mponeng Gold mine depth
66oC is temperature at bottom of mine

[Gold mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mponeng_Gold_Mine?wprov=sfti1) 

And average annual temperature is 18.2oC Gauteng province

49+18=67oC

The above is fairly close match so the theory doesn’t sound unreasonable to me."

Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,15037,gzb3gy,askscience,723,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

Is the direction of photons (produced by annihilation) random?,2,gyqv4i,askscience,7,"So I know that a particle and it's anti-particle will annihilate and 2 photons, that travel in opposite directions, are produced to conserve momentum. I was thinking about it and I had the thought: how do they know to be produced in a certain direction? (I'll give an example cos it's probably easier to explain what I mean)
So, if you imagine watching a particle come in perfectly horizontal from the right and it's anti-particle come in perfectly horizontal from the left, and they collide in the centre of your vision. They annihilate and end up producing 2 photons, one travelling straight up and the other travelling straight down. Now, what was stopping them (the 2 photons) from travelling towards/away from you or even back the way the particles initially came? Why did they choose* that up/down direction specifically as opposed to any of the other possible directions?

*I guess by 'why did they choose', I really mean 'what caused'"

What kind of phonetic changes in language are being observed right now?,9,gyk68y,askscience,0,"After coming across a video about the Great Vowel Shift in English and how drastic of a phonetic change it was over such a short period of time, I was wondering if we're going through any noticeable phonetic changes in language right now.

My initial assumption was that it must not be as prevalent considering we have so many examples of different speech patterns to compare and contrast our speech to, which would then influence our own pronunciation, compared to back then when it was very likely that you'd only ever speak with people in your village or neighboring villages.

But then I remembered that I grew up in an area of the United States without the cot/caught merger or the Mary/marry/merry merger, despite those language features being common throughout the vast majority of the United States, and was wondering if I was overvaluing the influence of a common media on the way people speak.

So I was wondering what kind of phonetic changes are being observed by linguists right now, not only necessary in English but in other languages as well."
How can you determine if an animal is placental based on it’s molar teeth?,2,gynag4,askscience,4,"So I was reading up on what could have been the smallest ever mammal, when the article inexplicably mentioned that scientists were able to tell that it was placental due to it’s molar teeth.

Why are galaxy arms stable?,6,gyqvub,askscience,3,"I know that galaxy arms are essentially density waves with stars moving in and out of the wave as they orbit around the galaxy centre. This part makes sense to me. The arms are brighter than the areas between them, and arms being brighter means that there are more stars and is therefore more dense. However, I don't understand how this density wave is stable.

A common analogy to explain galaxy arms is cars slowing down to look at an accident on the side of the road. There is always a clump of cars near the accident, but cars constantly move into and out of the clump. I don't like this analogy because I would think that stars would speed up, not slow down, as they approach the density wave because of the gravitational attraction between that star and the density wave. Similarly, I would think that a star moving out of the density wave would slow down for the same reason. If this were the case, I would expect galaxy arms to quickly fade into a more uniform disc, but we know this to not be the case. What am I missing here?"

Are there planet systems that orbit other objects?,8,gyz3p4,askscience,7,"I was wondering if there are systems that have planets which orbit other objects. 

For example if there is a system where other planets display similar behaviour to a solar system where there are a few planets somewhat close to each other that orbit an object, but instead of having a star as the centre it's something else? Maybe a bigger planet with enough gravitational pull (would that make the other planets its moons and the main planet just a rogue planet?) to be considered its own system.

A dumb question about roundabouts and rods. What would happen?,3,gyymks,askscience,6," Lets say someone had a really long rod and a roundabout and they made the roundabout spin at a speed close to the speed of light. Then they held the rod out away from the roundabout whilst on the roundabout. The other end of the rod would be moving around the roundabout at a faster speed than the speed at which the roundabout is spinning. Since the roundabout is spinning at a speed close to the speed of light one would think that the other end of the rod would be moving faster than the speed of light but this is not possible. So what would happen to the rod and the roundabout assuming that there is no atmosphere, the rod is indestructible and the person holding the rod is incredibly strong and and is stuck to the roundabout?"

Where in an atom exactly is a nucleus located? Is it in the centre or does its location vary from time to time?,5755,gyc73r,askscience,400,"Edit: The reason why I'm asking is that in one scene in Iron Man 2, Tony says, ""Jarvis, what does that look like to you? Not unlike an atom, in which case the nucleus would be here,"" pointing to the top-right corner of the holographic projection of a spherical atom. Although I'm a huge fan of the MCU, I know they're mostly scientifically inaccurate, but still sparked some curiosity within me. I am aware of the unpredictable nature of electrons, which is why I asked if it applied to the nucleus too. Assuming an atom is a so-so approximate sphere, would the nucleus exist exactly at the centre of the sphere or is it in the corner? You can calculate the probability of an electron's position by squaring it's wavefunction and integrating wrt to position. I was curious about the probability density of the nucleus's location, and is it highest at the centre or at another location? Does the unpredictable nature of electrons apply to the nucleus too? If so, can one determine the probability density of the location of a nucleus via the Schrödinger Equation? If so, is there a graph representing this probability density of the location of a nucleus? Hope I've made my question clearer :)

Does recovering from COVID-19 give less or more resistance than a theoretical vaccine would?,21,gy6zwk,askscience,15,"To my understanding, it is unclear exactly how much immunity being infected with COVID-19 and recovering gives you.

"What does ""discovering an antibody"" imply?",2,gy8gxq,askscience,7,"With the covid-19 epidemic going on, there is a lot of talk about ""discovering"" or ""finding"" antibodies. Could anyone shed a little light on exactly what this implies, for someone with little biology knowledge?

What I gather is happening, is that some people, or even animals, produce particular peptides/proteins that has a tendency to bind to the virus particles, thus stopping the virus from entering cells. But that is very vague, and I have some particular questions around this:

- Does the antibody have to be a peptide/protein? Or could it for example be a complex sugar?

- Are the antibodies always produced as part of a person's or animal's normal immune system? Or could they come from completely random sources - e.g. could, say, haemoglobin just magically happen to inhibit a virus? 

- Are we looking for potential antibodies only in humans, or also animals/plants? What determines where we look?

- Once you've discovered an antibody, how do you get it into patients? Is it as simple as genetically engineering a yeast cell to produce the antibody, and then injecting said antibody into patients' blood? I obviously assume it's much more complicated than that, so would be interested to hear the key challenges."

Here's what I don't get: millions of people in the Western world (and in other areas that don't have malaria) travel to sub-Saharan Africa and other endemic regions every year. Surely there'd be at least a few cases a year of somebody getting infected, going back home (e.g. to a country like Canada) before developing symptoms, other mosquitos (in Canada) biting that person, and then those mosquitos spreading it around the population. Why does this never happen? I feel like I'm missing something fundamental, but I don't know what.

How come gold is so electronegative despite it's position on the periodic table?,5,gxb9gi,askscience,5,"I'm sure we were all taught in school that as you move to the right in the periodic table atoms become more electronegative, and the same thing happends as we move up the periodic table. We were also taught why this is. As we move to the right the outer shell of the atom fills up, and the fuller the outer shell the easier it would be to fill up the shell by adding electrons and the more intensly it will attract electrons. The move we move upwards the smaller the atoms become, the closer their outer shells are to the positively charged core and the bigger the pull the core is able to excert.

Gold, among a few other metals, break this trend. Gold is as electronegative as carbon (electronegativity of 2.54 vs 2.55) despite being to the right of tallium (1.62). Why is this?

Do chameleons (or cuttlefish or other animals) decide when and how to change colors?,3,gxfpom,askscience,2,"There are a bunch of animals with the ability to change color for different reasons (warning signs, to cool off, active camouflage). Can these animals choose when to change colors, or is it an automatic response to their environment? Is this different for animals like chameleons, who use color to regulate temperature or ward off predators, than it is for animals like cuttlefish that primarily use it as camouflage? And can an animal like a cuttlefish choose to change to a color/texture that's different than its surroundings?"
A quick question about stomach viruses?,5,gxdplh,askscience,2,"I hope this doesn’t violate rule 1, but my question is essentially about the life of a virus on a surface. I know most articles say most viruses typically only last a few hours to even a few weeks on a surface, but my question is about what happens after that time. Lets say a few months have passed, would that surface still be able to get you sick or would the viruses be “dead and gone” by then and not likely to get you sick again?"

Via what mechanism do free electrons in metal produce thermal radiation?,69,gxa8m7,askscience,10,"Since they are free, electrons in metal don't have an orbital to return to. So how do they lose their excess energy? Is it via bremsstrahlung with collisions with other electrons or being stopped by metal ions at the surface?

Do all beans in a pod have the same exact genetic make up?,12,gx1nii,askscience,7,"Like take edamame for example. Slice that open and you’ll get yer self some beans. Are each one of those beans genetically independent? Y’know it’s their own fruit, it’s gonna do what it wants. Or are they all completely identical genetically. I’m making a character that gains different abilities based on the foods they’ve eaten. It made me curious as to the actual science behind it. I figured you guys could help me out. Or if anything I brought an odd chuckle to your feed. But so like for example. You’ve just eaten edamame and arise from the edaMAMA pod next to a healthy batch of bean bros.

Does surface texture/roughness have much impact on the solubility of a substance?,7,gx4fcy,askscience,4,I'm thinking because a highly rough surface will technically have more surface area.

What is a phase 3 clinical trial when we talk about vaccines?,9,gx4q76,askscience,8,"My understanding of the phases of clinical trials goes like this;

Phase 1: test safety in small number of healthy people.

Phase 2: test safety in small number of sick people and obtain early data whether it works.

Phase 3: test efficacy in large number of sick people.

Phase 4: use new treatment in the clinic and study it.

My question is this. Vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent the sickness. So who gets studied in Phase 3? Do you just wait to see how many of those people end up sick after they get the vaccine?"

What happens when a device is tuned into a frequency that more than one source is broadcasting in? Would it mash the sounds together, or just result in audio static? Does that mean that someone could play a bunch of noise on all available frequencies in order to drown out whoever is using those frequencies in broadcasting range?

"By blowing the outer sides of a mug, how much more or less effective is this than blowing the top of the mug (directly at the liquid)?",44,gx370u,askscience,12,"Background:  The question comes as  result of my high school science teacher  suggesting in order to cool our  solution in the beaker, we should blow  the outer sides of the beaker  and shouldn't blow from the top directly down into the  solution (like most would when  cooling a hot beverage). I believe he said this  at the time because the fumes  of the solution may have been hazardous  or the solution may splash if we  blow too hard.

Thoughts:  The  sides of mugs usually have a bigger surface area than the  top of  the hot beverage. Via conduction, my thoughts are that the  heat  should disperse into the mug quite rapidly. Additionally, if the  hot beverage is stirred, the surface area touching the sides of the mug is  even more  significant.

Personally, I feel blowing the top of the mug has always been better because I feel the heat escaping as I blow but I'm not sure if this means it's actually better than blowing the sides.

Also, possible variables to consider is stirring and if this would change the outcome, and for the sake of having a clearer direction for this question, lets say the mug is ceramic and holds approximately 250ml (just imagine a typical white mug with a handle)."

Can someone please explain some aspects of E=MC^2?,18,gwxjua,askscience,18,"Sorry in advance if these are dumb questions, just trying to understand Einstein’s equation better. 

I understand E represents energy, usually potential energy, but what unit is E measured in? Is it dependent on what units are used in the case of M and C (i.e. using grams or kilograms etc, meters per second or kilometer per second etc) or are all of the variables associated constant units? If it’s constant, what is the correct unit to use for each variable?

For example, take a 5 kg object. Multiply by the speed of light (defined in this case as 299,792,458 m/s), squared, (8.987551787368e16 m/s), which gives us 4.493775893684e17. What unit is this number measured in? 

What makes the speed of light relavent to measuring energy in objects with mass? If light is made up of photons, and photons have a mass of 0, that would make the energy of photons equal to 0 according to this equation. Wouldn’t that mean light contains no energy, and therefore isn’t a form of energy like we know it to be? If it’s not a form of energy, why is light warm? How would solar panels work? How would photosynthesis work? How are lasers powerful enough to cut through metal? These are just examples to explain my thought process, not necessarily other questions that need to be answered. 

Thanks y’all, I’ve tried googling (albeit not as hard as I could’ve) but I found nothing that answers these questions, and figured it would be easier to ask."

"It seems that we can determine nearly instantaneously whether we can remember something. Is this true? And if so, how can this happen so fast, and how do we know when to “give up” because we “just can’t remember” something?",9,gw63ul,askscience,1,"For context, I will say that when preparing for the California bar exam, we had a special bar prep course — no, not Barbri — taught by a team of (neuropsychology or some related field) attorneys who taught us how to memorize all 30(ish) legal topics into 3- and 4-level deep hierarchy trees. 

Ultimately, we were able to literally actually “search” this tree in our mind’s eye to nearly instantly recall whatever we needed on demand.

Effectively, we were taught, for those brief months, how to employ a photographic memory.

The full tree persisted for a few months after the exam and it was a fascinating experience to be able to recall so much information on demand.

But I noticed then — and still, now — that it seems the time to, for lack of a better word, to Spotlight Search our memory, as it were, appears to be a virtually instantaneous act.

So I’m just wondering: is this true? And if so, how exactly can memory work that quickly? And crucially, how do we know when “we just can’t remember” something and give up trying?"

Are epigenetic changes a cause or consequence of ageing ?,2,gwhf9e,askscience,6," 

Hello ,

I'd like an educated opinion about this topic .

We know that epigenetic changes occur as aging goes on , hence the epigenetic clock .

But what is the root cause of this changes ?

\- Are they objectively detrimental and just a direct consequence of the damage sustained by the chromatin . Alterations that would cause rejuvenation if reversed ?

\- Do they result of an adaptation to ageing : purpously methylating promoters to reduce activity, thus limiting aberrant proteins / cancer ? ( for example testosterone / estrogene reduction could be viewed as a way for the body to limit cancer risk )

The first hypothesis seems simplistic to me but it's what most papers i read seem to imply ."

"AskScience AMA Series: My name is Matija Ćuk, and I am a research scientist at the SETI Institute specializing in the orbital dynamics of solar system bodies. AMA!",3496,gvrvto,askscience,284,"I earned my undergrad degree in astrophysics at the University of Belgrade, Serbia, in 1999, and then I did my PhD in astronomy at Cornell University in 2005. I specialize in the orbital dynamics of solar system bodies, using their present orbit to figure out their past history. I usually use computer simulations, and my job involves quite a bit of programming. Back in graduate school I discovered the BYORP effect, which is driven by solar radiation and which changes the orbits of small binary asteroids very quickly (astronomically speaking). In 2012, Sarah Stewart and I had a paper in Science where we proposed that Earth was spinning very fast when the moon-forming collision happened, which made it possible to make the moon from Earth's material. My part was to show how Earth could lose excess spin afterwards through complex interactions between the Sun and the Moon. In 2016, I revisited this issue and found that early Earth was probably not only spinning super fast but also had a large axial tilt. I have also worked on the dynamics of Saturn's moons, and I proposed in 2016 that Saturn's inner moons and rings are probably only about 100 million years old. Cassini spacecraft results later suggested this is indeed the case, at least for the rings. My latest paper is on the past orbits of Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, and how the orbit of Deimos makes sense only if Mars had a large ring about 3 billion years ago.

Would a constant acceleration from unlimited energy produce an observation of a non-linear acceleration from a different reference point?,5,gvnuhy,askscience,4,"I am by no means very studied in physics or general relativity.

If my very basic understanding of a factor of general relativity is correct, the faster an object moves compared to another object, the slower time appears to move for that object.

Since velocity is a function of time, and time in affected by relative velocities, would an object under constant acceleration appear to an observer to non accelerate in a linear fashion?

As the object moves faster and faster, would the time dilation produce an effect where the object, moving in its own relative field, experiences the same acceleration, but from out outside perspective, due to a comparitively slower time dilation, see the object as accelerating faster and faster, in a third derivative of position sense.


To perhaps clarify.

If Velocity is related to time, and time is related to velocity, would not an accelerating object eventually appear to an outside observer as having infinite acceleration and velocity due to having no time? A division by zero scenario?"

How do stem cells get to the axillary meristem?,3,gvalvw,askscience,2,"I am wondering, as the shoot apical meristem begins to grow do some stem cells migrate over to the axillary meristem that originally existed in the SAM. Alternatively since some plant cells are totipotent, do normal cells convert back to stem cells in order to generate the axillary meristem?"
Why does the Jet stream converge and diverge?,6,gvig7j,askscience,1,"From what i've understood about meteorology; low and high pressure happens when e.g. the jet stream converges or diverges. I understand the basics of how this causes low and high pressure, and how the jet streams works, but not why it converge and diverge.

What causes the convergence and divergence in the first place? Has it something to do with the temperature gradient? if so, what causes the temperature to vary that much, so close together?"
How is it possible that viruses lead to the origin of life if viruses need a living host to survive?,7,gvlw0q,askscience,4,"According to the virus-first hypothesis, DNA-based viruses predate cellular life and contributed to its formation.

Can Rat Lungworm nematodes survive in dead snail shells?,1,gv8pc0,askscience,1,"I recently read about rat lungworm disease and that people usually get the disease from eating infected snails or consuming unwashed vegetables that contain snail secretions. I'm wondering if dead snail shells pose a risk as well. 

Can the nematode that carries the rat lungworm disease survive in the muck of a dead snail shell? 

Is there a realistic risk of getting rat lungworm disease from handling and playing with dead snail shells?

Is this disease everywhere? I see a lot of discussion about it in Hawaii and Asia. Is it in the continental US (I am in Texas)?

Thank you!"
Are there any birds which produce a blue pigment?,5,gv6x0w,askscience,6,"I've seen statements to the effect of ""no bird species can make blue from pigments"" ([example](https://insider.si.edu/2016/04/blue-bird-not-blue/)), but I've also seen many sources saying that blue is only ""typically"" the result of structural color ([example 1](https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2007/oct/16/birds-physics), [example 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_jay)).

But I can't find any specific mentions of a particular bird species which manufacture a blue pigment, so I'm left wondering if any actually exist or if all of the sources saying it's ""typically"" the result of structural color are just hedging in case there's one they didn't know about.

Do we know of even a single bird species which has non-structural blue color?"

What is the relationship between insulin and hGH?,5,gv3p74,askscience,0,"Hello everyone!
I am a last year med student I was reading my physiology textbook(Guyton’s) and something confused me.
In the book in some chapter it says different thing about insulin secretion and insulin resistance mechanism of hGH also Insulin like Growth Hormone.
I can understand some of them true but I think there is a problem I couldn’t get it.
From clinic I know hGH cause insulin resistance.
In book it says different things.
hGH secreted in lack of insulin
In other chapter it says hGH necessary for insulin action and also insulin and hGH synergetic.
I googled and in many places it says different things
Like in wiki says insulin induce growth hormone secretion.
Also at beginning in book glucagon inhibit insulin secretion later it promotes it.
What am I missing?

How does the ancient eruption of Krakatoa compare to our most recent volcanic eruptions and atomic bombs?,13,gveiup,askscience,9,"I actually asked this in r/homeworkhelp not too long ago, but I am genuinely still curious about this.

Black Lives Matter,50820,gvc7k9,askscience,3031,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

Why do some very expensive CPUs use lots of slow cores vs. fewer very fast cores?,12,gv2pxp,askscience,17,"Basically my question as an amateur computer builder and IT curious person with not a ton of in depth knowledge of computer engineering is this: 

Server grade processors, which have MSRPs that at the highest price point are $20,000+US, seem to utilize tons of cores running in the mid 2.5 GHz range per core. 

High end enthusiast processors run significantly less in the $500 - $1000 range and have core speeds that are now pushing past the 5 GHz range per core. 

What are the limitations or engineering reasons why you don't see at this moment, Intel or AMD releasing CPUs with massive core counts and also massive clock speeds? Wouldn't it theoretically be an advantage to have a ton of super fast cores? Are the reasons economic or due to engineering or technological limitation?   


A more minor follow up would be is this something that the future of CPU design has in store or is it less practical as high core counts and programs meant to utilize multi-core systems become more common and standard?"

Are there diagnostic tests for COVID that don’t use genetic material? How do/would they work?,1,guthgy,askscience,5,"I understand that the current approach for positive diagnosis of COVID-19 uses the RT-PCR method, which looks for the presence or absence of viral genetic material to confirm whether or not the person is infected. One problem with this approach is that a person who has recovered from COVID might still have the viral genetic material in their system but no “live” virus. In that case, the RT-PCR test could be a false indicator of potential infectiousness.

Are there tests under development - or available for other viruses - that look for something that is a better indicator of infectiousness? For example, are there tests that look for the presence of viral proteins or which try to cultivate the virus in vitro to evaluate whether the person is infectious? What would it take to develop a similar test for COVID?"

I understand that this is the result of my immune system reacting to a foreign chemical introduced into the body. But what I don't understand is why? The oil from poison ivy isn't a virus or an infections agent. So why does the immune system attack it?

Are these the results of a defect in our immune system, or does the body attack these substances and the cells they encounter to prevent a larger problem?

That is where this question originally came from, but I think I found a possible answer that I will address in a second. 

The main example I'm questioning is a regular propane grill, I don't understand how the fire doesn't run back up the fuel line and blow up the tank. It seems like the gas is coming out slow enough that this would be possible.

I have seen videos of people spraying hair spray and lighting it on fire, then the whole can explodes. How does this happen, but my propane tank doesn't explode on my grill?

In regards to the SpaceX rockets, my uneducated assumption is that the fuel is coming out of the pumps into the combustion chamber at such high speeds that the only way the flames can go is out.

Can someone explain the pathiophysiology of Basal Cell Carcinoma?,0,gtvz8c,askscience,1,"I started biology this here, and I'm struggling to wrap my head around the concepts of how it occurs.

What I THINK I understand, is that UV irradiation damages the Pitch1 proteins, which would usually suppress the release the Smoothened protein. Occasionally the Sonic Hedgehog proteins would bind with the Pitch1, and release the smoothened with information for cell proliferation. But when the ptch1 are damaged, they will release the smoothened without directions, and this leads to unregulated cell proliferation, ie basal cell carcinoma.

Am I on the right track?"

Why do particles that are not noble gas atoms want to become ions? If the reasoning is to maintain a ground state or low entropy then why aren't more electrons transferred to minimise the space between sub-atomic particles and minimise the entropy of the atomic system?,3,gtx0gw,askscience,4,"Looking at sodium metal and a sodium ion in NaCl, when sodium metal reacts with water it violently gives off its valence electron and causes a massive exothermic reaction after which the remainder sodium is now stable with its new valence electron shell filled. But what is the benefit in this?  


I understand that they want to have a ground state but what's the benefit of that? I've heard one view on Quora suggesting that it's to do with the universe favouring less entropy in a system. So by becoming an ion there's less entropy within the sodium atom because the sub-atomic particles are closer together but.... by that logic why doesn't the atom give off MORE electrons so the remainder sub-atomic particles are closer together to minimise the system entropy?

"Why do veins look blue, even when it is not under cutaneous tissue?",11,gtmkig,askscience,1,"I've been reading around, trying to find a satisfying answer, but it all seems to come down to ""well deoxygenated blood doesn't really look blue, it's just that the skin scatters the light in such a way that it looks blue.

However, I've got a few problems with that answer:

* In **osteogenesis imperfecta**, patients are described as having 'blue sclera' because of a thinning of the sclera, making the underlying choroidal blood vessels visible. There is *no skin* over these blood vessels, but a thin sclera.
* In **open surgeries** (like in an open heart surgery), you can see the veins as looking sort of dark-purplish.

In these contexts, are the overlying tissues (the sclera and, I guess, the adventitia of the veins) responsible for the blue discoloration by having the same scattering effects as the skin? How does this scattering effect come about, and how come pretty much all human tissues have those same properties?

Also, from what I searched online, people mainly seemed to focus on the distinction between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. But what about carbaminohemoglobin? I've seen some sources say carbaminohemoglobin has a 'distinctive blue color'. First off, is that true? If I took a blood sample, put it in a closed container, and then somehow got rid of all the O2 and replaced it with carbon dioxide, would the sample start becoming purplish-blue? If so, does that also play a role in the blue color of veins, or of the skin and mucosae of a cyanotic patient?

I know the question of 'why are veins blue' has probably been asked a lot, but I really haven't found any satisfying answers, especially in the case of osteogenesis imperfecta (which is what brought me to start researching this subject).

AskScience AMA Series: Hello Reddit! We're a group of climate researchers and engineers working on new technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Ask us anything!,4326,grhn03,askscience,464,"We're Nan Ransohoff and Ryan Orbuch from the Climate team at **Stripe**. Our work to mitigate the threat of climate change focuses on an underexplored part of the problem-removing carbon from the atmosphere directly, which is essential if the world is to meet its warming targets. Last week, after a rigorous search and review from independent scientific experts, we [announced](https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases) Stripe's first purchases from four negative emissions projects with great potential. We hope this will help create a large and competitive market for carbon removal. 

**CarbonCure**: I'm Rob Niven, Founder and CEO of [CarbonCure Technologies](https://www.carboncure.com/). Our technology chemically repurposes waste CO_2 during the concrete manufacturing process by mineralizing it into calcium carbonate (CaCO_3)-reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering material costs, and improving concrete quality. The technology is already being used at 200+ concrete plants from Miami to Singapore to build hundreds of construction projects from highrises to airports.

**Charm Industrial**: We're Kelly Hering and Shaun Meehan, founding engineers at [Charm Industrial](https://charmindustrial.com/). We have created a novel process for converting waste biomass into bio-oil, which we then inject deep underground as negative emissions-creating a permanent geologic store for carbon. 

**Climeworks**: I'm Jan Wurzbacher, co-CEO of [Climeworks](https://www.climeworks.com/). We use renewable geothermal energy and waste heat to capture CO_2 directly from the air, concentrate it, and permanently sequester it underground in rock formations. 

**Project Vesta**: We're Eric Matzner and Tom Green from [Project Vesta](https://projectvesta.org/). Project Vesta captures CO_2 by using an abundant, naturally occurring mineral called olivine. Ocean waves grind down the olivine, which captures atmospheric CO_2 from within the ocean and stabilizes it as limestone on the seafloor.

Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses?,10,gresli,askscience,2,
What is the process in which someone regains their memory if they have say retrograde amnesia?,8,gqt97y,askscience,1,"I’m kind of curious now because after watching The Vow for a second time (not a great movie if I’m being honest) I wonder what it would have been like if the girl had gotten her memory back. Say someone were to start regaining memories, would it all flood back at once some time after the accident or would it be small things or in chronological order? Would you remember the people or events you forgot when you wake up one morning? And how long would it take to fully regain your memory if you could?"
What makes the seeds in a chilli spicier than the flesh?,10,gqsz7u,askscience,5,
Does the mind decay as we sleep?,3,gqs6n6,askscience,4,"I don't know much about neuroscience or psychology but I remember reading that if we don't use particular brain functions for a long time it will start to decay. Like if someone doesn't play piano for 3 years they won't play as well as if they had been continuing to practice. 

So I had a thought, if someone slept for a long time without previous brain trauma would they lose brain function?

For example if someone was in a coma or cryogenically frozen(I know this is fictional) for several years would they still be the same functioning person as they were before?"
"What is the difference between osteoporosis, osteopenia & osteopetrosis?",2,gqryi7,askscience,4,
Do accessory spleens pose any intrinsic problems?,4,gqqj75,askscience,1,"I want to be clear: this is not a condition I have, I'm not asking for medical advice.  I simply found out about it as I was traversing a rather deep Wikipedia rabbit-hole, and now I'm curious about something.

What I""m finding in lay-understandable sources seems to suggest that accessory spleens are a problem primarily because they can complicate diagnosis or treatment of other issues.  For example, an accessory spleen can appear to be something else, or perhaps obscure something else, on a CT scan.  Or maybe if someone has a malady that requires a splenectomy, it's possible to only remove the main spleen and not realize that more needs to be done, meaning that the malady still exists.

So the impression I'm getting is that their mere presence, in and of themselves, does not cause any medical problems; they merely create practical difficulties in diagnosing and treating certain other problems that may arise.  Is this correct?"

"Can ants smell their food, and if so, from how far away?",5,gra1zp,askscience,8,"Do they find food through a sense of smell or some other sense, or is it just random luck? Just curious if the ants are actively ""hunting"" their food supply."
"Does the information passed through separated twisted pair photons, such as in quantum radar, travel faster than the speed of light?",2,gr2w1b,askscience,7,"I've been loosely following the subject, it is a game changer.  It was my understanding that when twisted photons are separated and one undergoes a state change, then the other registers the same state change regardless of the distance between the two.  Is this instantaneous?  If it is instantaneous, would not the information of the state change have, in effect, traveled faster than the speed of light?  Here is a small reference article:

"If a mother bird couldn't find enough food, would she let all her babies starve, or favor one/some and only feed them?",420,gr72dd,askscience,45,"Sort of a morbid question, I know. A friend had a nest of robins in their yard, and just found all the babies dead under the nest, and hypothesized that a lack of food could be the cause of death. I didn't think that was likely, but didn't want to bring it up or force the issue when my friend is quite sad about the dead baby birds. I figure that if the mama bird knew that she wasn't finding enough food, she would choose one of her babies to favor and feed with what she could find, to give the best chance of her genes surviving in the next generation. Is this true? Or would she feed them equally and let them all die? If it informs the answer, the mother is still alive. Thanks in advance!"
Do our bodies make antibodies with multiple paratope configurations for the same pathogen?,16,gr3z4m,askscience,4,"The SARS-COV-2 virus has many different unique epitopes. When a person gets infected, does their body actually make antibodies with multiple different paratopes? 

In other words, does a body's antibody response actually consist of various antibodies with various differing paratopes binding to various different unique epitopes on a single pathogen? 

A single SARS-CoV-2 virus could be surrounded by antibodies, but they're actually binding at different epitope areas based on their various different paratope configurations, with some having a higher binding affinity than others?"
"If the coronavirus is respiratory and you can't get it from eating infected food, why can you get it through your eyes?",41,gr40hr,askscience,24,"I have read articles stating that there is no evidence of anyone getting COVID-19 via food. The reasoning I have seen medical experts give is that COVID-19 and its virus are respiratory, so you get it from breathing it in, and if you eat it, your digestive system is separate so you won't get infected. But why then would getting the virus on your hands and then touching your eyes infect you? With your nose and mouth, my assumption was that you could end up breathing it in somehow. But I don't understand why it getting in your eyes would give it to you. I haven't seen this specifically explained anywhere. Thank you!"
Could previous exposure to other human coronaviruses prevent COVID-19 infection?,16,gqzrlj,askscience,2,"I was reading this article [T cells found in COVID-19 patients ‘bode well’ for long-term immunity](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/t-cells-found-covid-19-patients-bode-well-long-term-immunity) which says

>The teams also asked whether people who haven’t been infected with SARS-CoV-2 also produce cells that combat it. Thiel and colleagues analyzed blood from 68 uninfected people and found that 34% hosted helper T cells that recognized SARS-CoV-2. The La Jolla team detected this crossreactivity in about half of stored blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, well before the current pandemic began. The researchers think these cells were likely triggered by past infection with one of the four human coronaviruses that cause colds; proteins in these viruses resemble those of SARS-CoV-2.

Regarding previous exposure to human coronaviruses, [NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63) looks awfully similar to COVID-19 because they both attack via the ACE2 receptor. What kind of research would be needed to establish a link between NL63 exposure and COVID-19 immunity? If there is a link between NL63 (or another human coronaviruses) exposure and COVID-19 immunity, would intentionally exposing people to NL63 act like a natural vaccine to COVID-19?"
How fast does the humoral immune response occur (after becoming immune)?,1,gqy4yt,askscience,8,"Hi! 

I was wondering about the speed of the humoral immune response... Once immunity towards a certain antigen is achieved following a first time infection, how fast is the body's response to reinfection? Does the body develop and maintain the memory cells for an extended period of time, with these continuously pumping out antibodies with the specific surface receptors just in case reinfection occurs, or is there an ""oh shit"" moment wherein the body has to look through its ""immunity catalogue"" to then produce the required antibodies? And finally, whichever the process is, when the known antigen re-enters the body, how fast does it take for the body to trigger and execute the immune response so as to eradicate antigen from the body?

Thanks!"
Why does somatotropin (HGH) released from the pituitary gland cause bodily growth but not artificial HGH?,8,gqyww4,askscience,2,"In other words, why does an overactive pituitary gland, such as in gigantism/acromegaly, cause physical growth, but not when artificially introduced? I ask because I was reading about Robert Wadlow, and it's said he probably had a tumor on his pituitary that caused the excessive growth. Obviously his height wasn't the result of his genes, as his parents were normal height. So, if a malfunctioning pituitary can cause excessive growth, why doesn't artificial HGH? If a child had idiopathic short stature (ISS) due to genetics, why would HGH therapy not cause extra growth in the same way a tumor would?

Sorry if my question is worded strangely. Thanks!"
Is there research that shows that the absence of certain physical stressors that were present in distant past and experienced by our ancestors can worsen brain function and create mental health issues like depression?,3,gquta3,askscience,9,
Why is there so little neon in Earth's atmosphere?,34,gqxjaw,askscience,8,"Neon is the 5th most common element in the universe, more so than argon. The molar mass is also 20, higher than water’s 18, so it probably doesn’t escape into space like helium does. Despite being so common, argon outnumbers neon 500:1 in the atmosphere. Why? Is it because Earth simply didn’t start with any and that the argon came from radioactive decay? Is that why there is so much Ar-40 in the atmosphere because we never had Ar-36 to begin with?"
Why doesn't the CDC provided Oligonucleotide Sequences provided for Covid-19 testing match any sub-sequences provided in the updated published Covid-19 genome (version 2)?,7,gqxvrm,askscience,13,"I have been investigating the Covid-19 testing process and more specifically how the tests were created.

From my understanding, the CDC has published Oligonucleotide Sequences ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)) that should be used by US RT-PCR test creators to detect the presence of Covid-19. From my understanding, these published sequences are the signatures for detection of the virus.

In trying to understand how these sequences were created, I took the original published sequenced genome ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.2)) published in the ""Chinese Medical Journal"" and tried to find the provided CDC sequence as it is my assumption that the CDC published sequences should match the original covid-19 sequenced genome. I was able to successfully find the first provided forward primer ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT""  matching the end of line number 28261.

However, the scientists have updated the genome with a new version on Jan 17, 2020 ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947)) and I am unable to find the sequence ""GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT"" in this Covid-19 genome. I have also checked the reverse (CTG GGG TTT ...) without luck.

I would assume the entire point of picking good Oligonucleotide Sequences is they should stay static over all possible Covid-19 changes. The CDC clearly says it may change these sequences but they haven't. How is this possible to have a different published Covid-19 genome that the CDC's test doesn't detect? Isn't the fact the genome was updated problematic? Could the CDC test ""verified"" test not actually be effective as a result? Did the CDC do it's own large scale sequencing effort since the first sequence was collected from only 5 individuals."
What is the scientific term for the amount of current/electricity a material can endure before being destroyed/melting?,2,gqdl33,askscience,12,"I don't really know how to explain it but I'll do my best. Take a lightbulb, when it blows, what's the term for that limitation?"
"Do galaxies regularly ""disappear"" from the edge of the observable Universe due to the ever expanding nature of space?",6,gqdbhp,askscience,24,"Here are my assumptions:

1. The space in the Universe is expanding rapidly, attaining light speeds or even more at far away distances. This why we can only see a part of the Universe because light from beyond that point travels slower than the expanding space between it and us.

2. The space within the observable Universe(which let's assume is a sphere) is also expanding and therefore at a certain point the galaxy at the edge must ""spill"" out of the surface of the observable sphere.

Have we ever observed this phenomena?"

What causes the effect of trenchfoot?,2,gqq65y,askscience,3,"Ive been reading about ww1 and how one condition the soliders got was trench foot, where their foots would essentially melt or disintegrate.

"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Brian Greene, theoretical physicist, mathematician, and string theorist, and co-founder of the World Science Festival. AMA!",6217,gquwbq,askscience,555,"I'm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the Director of the university's Center of Theoretical Physics. I am also the co-founder of the [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/), an organization that creates novel, multimedia experience to bring science to general audiences.

My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. 

I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, *The Elegant Universe*, *The Fabric of the Cosmos*, *The Hidden Reality*, and just recently, *Until the End of Time*. *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)* and *[The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)* were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, *Icarus at the End of Time*, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage *[Light Falls](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)*, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.

These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.

I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.

I'll be here at 11 a.m. ET (15 UT), AMA!

Why does oHSV-1 transmit to one location and as gHSV-1?,1,gqoimz,askscience,1,"From reading some posts, it seems like when someone has oHSV-1, it seems to generally transmit as gHSV-1 rather than oHSV-1. But when people go through the motions of sex, other than the genitals, the mouth would probably be the area that's mostly exposed to oHSV-1.

"Why would a hotspot create a large igneous province in the middle of its lifespan, rather than the beginning?",2,gq41y2,askscience,2,"My understanding (I should note that I'm not a geologist) is that large igneous provinces occur as a result of mantle plumes, and then a hotspot is left afterwards; if the plate moves, a chain of hotspot-associated volcanism is left from the igneous province to its current location.

&#x200B;

But how is that possible without ""storing"" somewhere, even in a cache/temp folder, the password itself and not the encrypted version like it is supposed to be done for passwords ? 

Is there a relation between the encryption of a string, and the encryption of a substring so that it can be recognized from the encrypted version of a password that security conditions are not met ?

There was a [poll done recently](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/face-masks-poll-partisan-culture-war_n_5ec584fcc5b642a7d150e103) about public opinion re: wearing masks but someone pointed out that this paints a false picture in that  it makes it seem like there are two more or less equal groups on either side of the issue when that hasn't borne out with other research done specifically on that idea.

How does statistical analysis, and more specifically this sort of polling, take into account a large disparity in the actual number of pro/con respondents?

In terms of answer complexity, please assume that I'm functionally five years old when it comes to math. I'm mod of /r/dyscalculia for a reason."
What is the average for short-term memory sentence recall?,11,gposxp,askscience,7,"I tend to underline the key points of the books I read, and immediately write them down in a notebook from memory. I struggle with sentences longer than 20 words. I always reread after writing to detect any possible mistake that I may have made, then I add corrections in red when needed. After I while, I can see that I have no corrections in sentences up to 21 words. But every single sentence with at least 30 words has something in red: a comma, an inverted order of terms, the use of a synonym instead of the original word...

How dumb am I compared to the average foe?

Thanks!"

What are the deciding factors in the altitude that a plane flies?,5,gpodoa,askscience,26,"In these days of ever increasing economical efficiency, what are the main factors taken into consideration when determining the most fuel efficient altitude to fly?

Why is it 30,000 feet instead of 20,000... 10,000... or 5,000? Surely it takes a relatively large amount of fuel to get the plane 1,000 feet higher in the air. So why do they fly so high up?"

Do our ACE-2 receptors go through metamorphosis at any point throughout out lives?,0,gpjzx3,askscience,3,"So it's known that sars-cov-2 attaches to the ace-2 receptors within our lungs, and it's also known it doesn't seem to effect children as strongly. Is this possibly due to children having lungs that are still developing meaning the virus can't as readily identify the host cell? Or is it more likely that the smaller lung surface area means that children would on average be getting a smaller viral load due to less available binding sites?  I understand no one really has any solid answers at the moment but any ideas would be appreciated"

Don't antibody tests need to detect multiple configurations of antibodies?,7,gpb8dw,askscience,4,"I'm under the impression that multiple antibodies with different binding site structures can be made by different people for the same pathogen. Every piece of literature I read refer to ""the antibody"" for a certain pathogen like it's some kind of singular monolithic thing, where in reality I think antibodies for a certain pathogen are actually pluralistic things with a certain degree of variability? There is no ""antibody."" There is no ""the antibody"" for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 for instance can have multiple unique areas on their protein structures in which multiple different antibodies can be generated, so one recovered patient can have slightly different antibodies compared to another recovered patient, but both of their antibodies will still bind to different unique areas of SARS-CoV-2.

There are even companies that have whittled down numerous different antibody candidates to a few that have especially high neutralizing abilities against SARS-COV-2, the point being that multiple different antibodies can bind to one pathogen.

So when people talk about an ""antibody test,"" what are they talking about, exactly? 

Does the test actually detect the presence of *multiple* different antibodies, all of which have demonstrated binding effects with the virus? 

Or do the tests only detect one specific configuration of antibody, and can miss other antibody configurations, resulting in a false negative (the patient actually had been infected and did produce antibodies, just not the ones that the test is specific for)."

Does traveling above any given body’s escape velocity mean that you cannot enter into an orbit with that body?,4,gp8iwy,askscience,5,"I hope my question makes sense. If say you wanted to orbit the Alpha Centauri system or one of the specific stars therein, but you arrive at a fraction of the speed of light, say .01c. This would be far higher than any relevant escape velocity for the system. Where I get hazy is wether or not that means you could fall into a stable orbit at that speed. My interpretation of escape velocity means that any trajectory must be parabolic and until your velocity is below the escape value you cannot orbit that body no matter how eccentric or far flung your intended orbit is. Am I wrong? Am I misunderstanding the concept of escape velocity?"
How does a horse know it's a horse?,18,gp82x7,askscience,2,"This question occurred to me when introducing a new horse to one we've had for ages. As soon as they saw each other there was definite + immediate interest, and a lot of snorting, murmuring etc, which I took to be recognition that they were the same species. Horses don't react that way to cows for example. And I don't think it was smell - there was quite a strong cross wind that day.

So it seems that they recognised each other as horses by sight. Do they know that the animal they're looking at is the same as them? If so, how do they know that?

Death toll from 'herd immunity'?,7,gp4igq,askscience,34,"Hi, a lot of my friends are arguing 'herd immunity' as a sort of strategy for combating covid-19.  I generally respond that this will involve many times the number of deaths that have occurred already.  My rationale is quite simple: Covid-19 has a current 1.4% mortality rate (due mostly to old people and people with poor immune function), and 'herd immunity' involves at least 60% population immunity (likely higher to be more effective). That means that if we just let the disease continue to spread as it has, the final USA death count will be 330million x 60% x 1.4% = 2.8 million.  Even if we somehow could control who gets the virus to restrict it to the healthiest people, this would mean something like a 0.4% total mortality (lowest group-mortality by age seems to be around 0.2-0.3%, and let's assume it spreads a bit outside of that).  In this case, 330million x 60% x 0.4% = 800,000 dead.  Are these assumptions valid, or am I missing something major in my estimation?"

Why are green beans associated with botulism and not other fruits and vegetables?,11,gor5ir,askscience,5,
How is negative Kelvin achieved?,8,googs2,askscience,4,"I recently learned about negative kelvin, but cannot understand why it is considered a negative temperature.

Here is where my understanding is at:
1. I understand that atoms are brought to near 0K, meaning they have near zero kinetic energy.
2. I understand that these atoms need to have an upper energy limit so that they can be in a state of maximum potential energy during this process.
3. Temperature is not just the kinetic energy of particles, but includes interaction and potential energy as well.

Where my understanding breaks down is how inverting the kinetic and potential energies creates a negative Kelvin temperature. Why does taking an atom to it's upper energy limit create a negative temperature?

I read this article on it: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130104143516.htm
but I still do not understand it, and the hill/ball analogy did not help.

Edit: After further reading on the subject through this subreddit I have a basic understanding of Thermodynamic Beta and why negative Kelvin is considered negative, but I am still confused about the need for the energy limit, and inversion of potential and kinetic energies."
"Why aren't neutrinos ""supposed"" to travel away from us?",7,goszfj,askscience,3,"I read somewhere that neutrinos were observed leaving Earth instead of towards it, which could mean a parallel universe.

Why is the earths magnetic field the way it is?,6,gor1qn,askscience,9,"While watching a documentation on planets I was wondering why the magnetic fields always seemed to ""emit their magnetism"" (please excuse my lack of technical terms) on the north or South Pole. Visualizations of the magnetic fields always show the currents making their way from the poles. Since planets are (almost) a sphere I wondered why poles couldn't just be somewhere else. I figured it has something to do with the tilt and rotation, or the not perfect sphere. However, I am not invested enough to figure it out myself so here I am.
I hope my amateurish explanation and question is understandable! Thanks for your answers in advance."
What is the electrical current actually doing in am antenna?,19,gom9ko,askscience,8,"From what I've read so far, an antenna is just a conductive piece of metal and radio waves induce an electric current in it which can be decoded into sound or images. But a piece of metal can't discriminate and is being bombarded by every radio and TV station and wifi signal and garage remote in the area right? So are the electrons just flying around chaotically? How can you make an actual electric current when the electrons are being pulled in every direction at once?"
How old is the inner core of the Earth?,5,gojkcy,askscience,15,"I am trying to find out when the inner core was formed but every source I look at ranges too much from 50 million years after the earth formed to even 500 million years ago which over a 4.5 billion span is a lot.

Is there a specific taxonomic rank where one could say codon conservation begins?,3,go2tuy,askscience,2,"For protein translation, there are usually multiple codons that encode for a specific amino acid. However, there tends to be a favored codon for a specific organism, based upon the prevalence of that codon's corresponding tRNA in the cytosol. Because of this, for gene engineering purposes, there tends to be an optimal codon to use for a specific amino acid that will result in greater gene expression. I'm wondering as one moves up the taxonomic ranking (from species to domain), where does the optimal codon for amino acids start to deviate? Does it happen when you start comparing plants vs animals? Eukaryotes vs prokaryotes? Vertebrates vs invertebrates? Thanks!"

Humans/human ancestors have been eating cooked food for ~2 million years. Do we have any adaptations for eating hot food that other animals don't?,9,go58nt,askscience,3,"For example, everyone has the experience of biting into food that's too hot and burning the roof of their mouth. If something like a chimpanzee were to do that would their mouth burns be more serious or heal slower than ours? Or have our adaptations to working with fire regularly/eating cooked food been entirely behavioral (just don't get burned to begin with)?"
Is meat as we know it today biologically the same as meat from the cretaceous period or has it evolved over time?,6,go73ab,askscience,2,"I know next to nothing about biology so I apologize if this is a bad question.

Would the digestive tracts of an animal be able to digest meat from a different period of time or would there be any differences as a result of evolution that would somehow make it non digestible or non nutritious? 

For example, I know carnivores cant synthesize certain vitamins and therefore have to eat meat. Have these same vitamins existed consistently in meat since the dawn of time?

I'm legitimately curious and want to learn. Mods please don't remove for being too ""theoretical"", I'm trying my best to word it in a way that isn't."

Why is Austenitic Steel (FCC) Non-Ferromagnetic?,8,gohl34,askscience,6,"I know carbon steel has a Curie point near the austenitic transformation temperature, so I always thought that high temperature steel lost its ferromagnetism because the thermal energy kept re-orienting Weiss domains so they can't properly align. The blacksmith trick of using a magnet to tell if steel is austenitic is just a guess, because carbon steel actually reaches its Curie temperature a bit before the austentic transformation temperature. 

I didn't realize until recently that room temperature austenitic steel (stainless steel) is also not ferromagnetic. My first thought was that this was somehow due to crystal structure (some symmetry operation in FCC that forbids ferromagnetism?) but that doesn't work because there are other examples of FCC metals that exhibit ferromagnetism, like Ni or Co alloys.

My next thought was that Weiss domains in FCC might get thermally misaligned more easily, so perhaps the Curie temperature would be decreased in FCC metals, and Ni could stay ferromagnetic because it had a Curie temperature above 300K. However, Ni has a smaller magnetic moment per atom and a lower melting temperature (than iron or stainless steel), so assuming Curie temperatures occur at roughly the same homologous temperature, Ni should have a lower Curie temperature (it does have a lower Curie temperature than BCC iron).

That leaves me with no explanation for why steel loses its ferromagnetism upon becoming FCC. Does anyone have any ideas?"

How come gemstones don't cold weld?,6,goa9b5,askscience,4,"I understand that cold welding largely doesn't happen by accident (unless you're in space) because you have to remove any oxide layers and make very precise and extended contact. As far as I know, gemstones don't have oxide layers and since they're cut flat with high precision, what's to stop them from cold welding?

Is it more difficult for a virus to mutate if the host is healthy?,7,goauhq,askscience,7,"Friends and I got into an argument about this. My take is that the virus will simply mutate without regard to the immune system of the host. 

Their argument is that if the virus infects healthy people without infecting those who are immunocompromised or overall unhealthy, the virus becomes weaker and weaker. 

Can someone clear this up? It’s difficult to find an answer."

Can you help me understand Laplace transform and the frequency interpretation of a signal?,10,go5pjn,askscience,6,"I have studied all the facts regarding the subject (really cool part of maths) but I cant visualize the practical meaning of this.

For what I see, when you decompose a signal in an infinite sum of sines and cosines (even dilated or shrinked) you are giving each frequency a ""weight"" or a ""share"" on the total signal. What does it mean to filter a signal? Will it remove the ""low"" sinuisoids and cosinusoids?"
Which antibody fights COVID 19?,4,go2fzw,askscience,9,"So I have a few parts to this question...

I know there are 5 types of antibodies: IgG, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgE.

Are there different *subtypes* of these? For example, would your body produce one type of IgG to fight the common cold and a different type of IgG to fight COVID 19? (assuming IgG fights both for this example)

If not, and people are taking antibody tests to see if they already had COVID, how do we know elevated IgG levels (for example) doesn't mean someone has had shingles (or other illness) and that's the reason for elevated IgG levels? 

Thanks!"

Aerodynamics: why should max lift-to-drag airspeed be the same as min-drag airspeed?,10,gnzjxx,askscience,6,"I need help from someone who knows aerodynamics well, in connection with aerodynamics study material that all student pilots are asked to learn, specifically how the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio varies as a function of airspeed.

The basic idea is to give the pilot an intuition of the fact that lift grows quadratically with airspeed, and so (somewhat) does drag, but there's a component of drag (induced) that grows a lot if you fly slow. For this reason, total drag exhibits a U-shaped plot, and the airspeed corresponding to the butt of the U is a sweet spot that gives you best range. That's the airspeed you should fly at for best economy, and the airspeed to establish in case of engine loss, to achieve best glide distance. If you fly faster, you glide less, and if you also fly slower, you also glide less.

More specifically, Most ground schools, including official FAA sanctioned material, present the same or very similar airspeed-drag charts, all having airspeed in knots on the x axis, and arbitrary drag units on y. They all plot parasite, induced, form (sometimes) and total drag curves. (Total drag D is the sum of parasite, induced and form drag.) Here is an example: [https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course\_content\_popup.aspx?cID=104&sID=448](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course_content_popup.aspx?cID=104&sID=448)

They consistently make the claim that **the airspeed maximizing L/D is also the one that minimizes total drag**.

Note: they don't say that the two airspeeds (the one maximizing L/D and the one minimizing D) are **close enough** that we can confound them. No, they say they are the same.

I'm a weekend pilot with a background in engineering and a day job in a quantitative field, and this claim bothers me. I played around for five minutes with a graphic calculator and plugged in simple functions that look close enough to those in the abstract plots:

* DI = Induced drag = 1/(500v)
* DF = Form Drag = 5 + 1/100 (v-45)\^2
* DP = Parasite Drag = 1/200 v\^2
* L = Lift = 1/5 v\^2   \*\*\*
* D = Total Drag = DI+DF+DP

Of course, empirical experiments confirm my intuition that there's no chance in hell that argmax(L(v)/D(v)) matches argmin(D(v)).

Am I right? Am I wrong?

Of course the FAA's goal is not to teach physics, it's rather to give pilot simplified, actionable intuition that is mostly physically correct and that inspires the right in-flight decision.

But I'd like to hear from an expert how things really are.

**UPDATE:**

**SOLVED! ------------** Thanks to the kind redditors who answered.

I was incorrectly assuming that in these charts, lift was made to vary as a function of airspeed.

This is a result of my brain being primed to equation L = 1/2 CL ρ S v^(2), the lift equation, that one typically studies in the same chapter.

If you assume constant CL and constant air density ρ, of course lift grows quadratically with airspeed.

However, these charts assume steady, unaccelerated, level flight, in which lift is constant, and made to exactly balance weight. As airspeed grows, smaller and smaller AoA are needed to balance W, and correspondingly smaller and smaller CL values.

Then, L becomes a constant, and   argmax(L(v)/D(v)) = argmax(c/D(v)) = argmin(D(v)).

Thank you!

Why are new spacecraft today built as a pod on top of a rocket instead of evolving the shuttle design ideas?,24,gnv8mf,askscience,14,"Something that has been bothering me and I can't really find an answer. I know the shuttle program was primarily scrapped due to cost but why are the new space craft being built by spacex and others following the design ideas of the apollo missions?

Personally, the space shuttle looks better, has more capability due to its cargo space and arm so can be used for more things than just ferrying people between  places.

Is it simply cost or is there another reason?"

"How to interpret the of power laws in the spectrum of a time series (understanding white, pink, red brown and black noise)?",6,gnxgvp,askscience,6,"From my understanding if a frequency spectrum is essentially frequency independent then this is white noise. The interpretation being that there is no correlation in time in the data. 

&nbsp;

For brown noise, such that the frequency spectrum has a 1/f^2 power law, this is interpreted as there is no correlation between increments. That is the signal is performing a random walk in time.

&nbsp;

How does one interpret the “various shades” of pink noise where 1/f^alpha with 0<alpha<2? I get the idea of for alpha = 1 then we have the same energy in each octave. But this does not really give a physical understanding in the same way as for white and brown noise."

I just don't think it's a conservative strategy.

Wouldn't it be better to generate the protein by something like ecoli, then just inject the raw protein spike into humans?

I assume there must be some core reason.  My thinking is that they're taking the raw RNA slice from COVID19 directly and that it would only replicate in humans?"
